        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch07_s03_s01_p01">Financial analysts measure the value of a company in terms of profits and stock. For employees, however, the value of a job is also emotional. The root of the word <em class="emphasis">emotion</em> comes from a French term meaning “to stir up.” And that’s a great place to begin our investigation of emotions at work. More formally, an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">emotion</a><span class="glossdef">Feeling that occurs quickly and profoundly in response to an event that is desired (positive) or undesired (negative).</span></span> is defined as a short, intense feeling resulting from some event. Not everyone reacts to the same situation in the same way. For example, a manager’s way of speaking can cause one person to feel motivated, another to feel angry, and a third to feel sad. Emotions can influence whether a person is receptive to advice, whether they quit a job, and how they perform individually or on a team.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn07_065">Cole, M.

In the workplace, these events may include achieving a goal or receiving praise from a superior. Individuals experiencing a positive emotion may feel peaceful, content, and calm. A positive feeling generates a sensation of having something you didn’t have before. As a result, it may cause you to feel fulfilled and satisfied. Positive feelings have been shown to dispose a person to optimism, and a positive emotional state can make difficult challenges feel more achievable.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn07_066">Kirby, L.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch07_s03_s01_p03">Emotions are also useful for creative tasks, because positive individuals tend to be more creative and open to new ideas. In addition to helping with employee creativity, companies such as Microsoft Corporation often want to understand which features of their products produce not just high ratings for usability but also high emotional ratings. Individuals with strong positive emotional reactions are more likely to use their product and recommend it to others.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn07_068">Weler, M. H. (2008).

In the workplace, these events may include not having your opinions heard, a lack of control over your day-to-day environment, and unpleasant interactions with colleagues, customers, and superiors. Negative emotions play a role in the conflict process, with those who can manage their negative emotions finding themselves in fewer conflicts than those who do not.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch07_s03_s01_p05">The unwanted side effects of negative emotions at work are easy to see: An angry colleague is left alone to work through the anger; a jealous colleague is excluded from office gossip, which is also the source of important office news. But you may be surprised to learn that negative emotions can help a company’s productivity in some cases. Anger at another company’s success, for example, can spark a burst of positive effort on behalf of a competitor. Jealousy about another division’s sales figures may inspire a rival division to work harder. While negative emotions can be destructive in the workplace, they can inspire bursts of valuable individual action to change situations that aren’t working the way they should.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn07_069">Jordan, P. J., Lawrence, S. A., &amp; Troth, A. C. (2006).

        <h2 class="title editable block">Emotional Contagion</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch07_s03_s02_p01">Both positive and negative emotions can be contagious, with the spillover of negative emotions lasting longer than positive emotions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn07_070">Linguistics may be clue to emotions, according to Penn State research. (2005, January 24). Retrieved June 1, 2008, from the <em class="emphasis">ScienceDaily</em> Web site: <a class="link" href="http://www.sciencedaily.com_/releases/2005/01/050123213111.htm">http://www.sciencedaily.com_/releases/2005/01/050123213111.htm</a>.</span> As you may have experienced in the past, contagion can be especially salient in a team setting. Research shows that emotions are contagious and that team members affect one another even after accounting for team performance.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn07_071">Ilies, R., Wagner, D. T., &amp; Morgeson, F. P. (2007). Explaining affective linkages in teams: Individual differences in susceptibility to contagion and individualism-collectivism. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">92</em>, 1140–1148.</span> One explanation for negative emotions’ tendency to linger may be a stronger connection to the fight-or-flight situations people experience. Anger, fear, and suspicion are intentionally unpleasant messages urging us to take action immediately. And to make sure we get the message, these emotions stick around.</p>

Charisma, positive emotions and mood contagion. <em class="emphasis">Leadership Quarterly</em>, <em class="emphasis">17</em>, 317–334.</span> We can also imagine how negative emotions can be transferred. Imagine you’re working behind the counter at a fast-food restaurant. Your mood is fine, until a customer argues with you about an order. You argue back. The customer leaves in a huff. Your anger emotions continue, turning into negative feelings that last throughout the day. As you might guess, you are more likely to make mistakes and find ordinary challenges annoying when you’re experiencing negative emotions. Unchecked, your negative emotions can spread to those around you. A negative interaction with one customer can spill over onto interactions with another customer.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn07_074">Pugh, S. D. (2001).
