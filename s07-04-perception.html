    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_p01">Our behavior is not only a function of our personality, values, and preferences, but also of the situation. We interpret our environment, formulate responses, and act accordingly. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Perception</a><span class="glossdef">The process with which individuals detect and interpret environmental stimuli.</span></span> may be defined as the process with which individuals detect and interpret environmental stimuli. What makes human perception so interesting is that we do not solely respond to the stimuli in our environment. We go beyond the information that is present in our environment, pay selective attention to some aspects of the environment, and ignore other elements that may be immediately apparent to other people. Our perception of the environment is not entirely rational. For example, have you ever noticed that while glancing at a newspaper or a news Web site, information that is interesting or important to you jumps out of the page and catches your eye? If you are a sports fan, while scrolling down the pages you may immediately see a news item describing the latest success of your team. If you are the parent of a picky eater, an advice column on toddler feeding may be the first thing you see when looking at the page. So what we see in the environment is a function of what we value, our needs, our fears, and our emotions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_074">Higgins, E. T., &amp; Bargh, J. A. (1987).

Our coverage of biases and tendencies in perception is not exhaustive—there are many other biases and tendencies on our social perception.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_s01_p01">Our visual perception definitely goes beyond the physical information available to us.

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_s01_p02">Our visual perception is often biased because we do not perceive objects in isolation. The contrast between our focus of attention and the remainder of the environment may make an object appear bigger or smaller. This principle is illustrated in the figure with circles. Which of the middle circles is bigger? To most people, the one on the left appears bigger, but this is because it is surrounded by smaller circles. The contrast between the focal object and the objects surrounding it may make an object bigger or smaller to our eye.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_s01_p03">How do these tendencies influence behavior in organizations? You may have realized that the fact that our visual perception is faulty may make witness testimony faulty and biased. How do we know whether the employee you judge to be hardworking, fast, and neat is really like that? Is it really true, or are we comparing this person to other people in the immediate environment? Or let’s say that you do not like one of your peers and you think that this person is constantly surfing the Web during work hours. Are you sure? Have you really seen this person surf unrelated Web sites, or is it possible that the person was surfing the Web for work-related purposes? Our biased visual perception may lead to the wrong inferences about the people around us.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_s02_p01">Human beings are prone to errors and biases when perceiving themselves. Moreover, the type of bias people have depends on their personality. Many people suffer from <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">self-enhancement bias</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency to overestimate our performance and capabilities and to see ourselves in a more positive light than others see us.</span></span>. This is the tendency to overestimate our performance and capabilities and see ourselves in a more positive light than others see us. People who have a narcissistic personality are particularly subject to this bias, but many others are still prone to overestimating their abilities.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_077">John, O. P., &amp; Robins, R. W. (1994). Accuracy and bias in self-perception: Individual differences in self-enhancement and the role of narcissism. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">66</em>, 206–219.</span> At the same time, other people have the opposing extreme, which may be labeled as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">self-effacement bias</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency to underestimate our performance and capabilities, and to see events in a way that puts ourselves in a more negative light.</span></span>. This is the tendency for people to underestimate their performance, undervalue capabilities, and see events in a way that puts them in a more negative light. We may expect that people with low self-esteem may be particularly prone to making this error. These tendencies have real consequences for behavior in organizations. For example, people who suffer from extreme levels of self-enhancement tendencies may not understand why they are not getting promoted or rewarded, while those who have a tendency to self-efface may project low confidence and take more blame for their failures than necessary.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_s02_p02">When perceiving themselves, human beings are also subject to the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">false consensus error</a><span class="glossdef">How we as human beings overestimate how similar we are to other people.</span></span>. Simply put, we overestimate how similar we are to other people.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_078">Fields, J. M., &amp; Schuman, H. (1976).

The “false consensus effect”: An egocentric bias in social perception and attribution processes. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">13</em>, 279–301.</span> We assume that whatever quirks we have are shared by a larger number of people than in reality. People who take office supplies home, tell white lies to their boss or colleagues, or take credit for other people’s work to get ahead may genuinely feel that these behaviors are more common than they really are. The problem for behavior in organizations is that, when people believe that a behavior is common and normal, they may repeat the behavior more freely. Under some circumstances this may lead to a high level of unethical or even illegal behaviors.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Social Perception</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_s03_p01">How we perceive other people in our environment is also shaped by our values, emotions, feelings, and personality. Moreover, how we perceive others will shape our behavior, which in turn will shape the behavior of the person we are interacting with.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_s03_p02">One of the factors biasing our perception is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stereotypes</a><span class="glossdef">Generalizations based on a perceived group characteristic.</span></span>. Stereotypes are generalizations based on group characteristics. For example, believing that women are more cooperative than men, or men are more assertive than women, is a stereotype. Stereotypes may be positive, negative, or neutral. Human beings have a natural tendency to categorize the information around them to make sense of their environment. What makes stereotypes potentially discriminatory and a perceptual bias is the tendency to generalize from a group to a particular individual. If the belief that men are more assertive than women leads to choosing a man over an equally (or potentially more) qualified female candidate for a position, the decision will be biased, potentially illegal, and unfair.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_s03_p03">Stereotypes often create a situation called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">self-fulfilling prophecy</a><span class="glossdef">This happens when an established stereotype causes one to behave in a certain way, which leads the other party to behave in a way that makes the stereotype come true.</span></span>. This cycle occurs when people automatically behave as if an established stereotype is accurate, which leads to reactive behavior from the other party that confirms the stereotype.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_079">Snyder, M., Tanke, E. D., &amp; Berscheid, E. (1977). Social perception and interpersonal behavior: On the self-fulfilling nature of social stereotypes. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">35</em>, 656–666.</span> If you have a stereotype such as “Asians are friendly,” you are more likely to be friendly toward an Asian yourself. Because you are treating the other person better, the response you get may also be better, confirming your original belief that Asians are friendly. Of course, just the opposite is also true. Suppose you believe that “young employees are slackers.” You are less likely to give a young employee high levels of responsibility or interesting and challenging assignments. The result may be that the young employee reporting to you may become increasingly bored at work and start goofing off, confirming your suspicions that young people are slackers!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_s03_p04">Stereotypes persist because of a process called selective perception. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Selective perception</a><span class="glossdef">When we pay selective attention to parts of the environment while ignoring other parts.</span></span> simply means that we pay selective attention to parts of the environment while ignoring other parts. When we observe our environment, we see what we want to see and ignore information that may seem out of place. Here is an interesting example of how selective perception leads our perception to be shaped by the context: As part of a social experiment, in 2007 the <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em> newspaper arranged Joshua Bell, the internationally acclaimed violin virtuoso, to perform in a corner of the Metro station in Washington DC. The violin he was playing was worth $3.5 million, and tickets for Bell’s concerts usually cost around $100. During the rush hour in which he played for 45 minutes, only one person recognized him, only a few realized that they were hearing extraordinary music, and he made only $32 in tips. When you see someone playing at the metro station, would you expect them to be extraordinary?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_080">Weingarten, G. (2007, April 8). Pearls before breakfast. <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>. Retrieved January 29, 2009, from <a class="link" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/04/AR2007040401721.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/04/AR2007040401721.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_s03_p05">Our background, expectations, and beliefs will shape which events we notice and which events we ignore. For example, the functional background of executives affects the changes they perceive in their environment.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_081">Waller, M. J., Huber, G. P., &amp; Glick, W. H. (1995). Functional background as a determinant of executives’ selective perception. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal</em>, <em class="emphasis">38</em>, 943–974.</span> Executives with a background in sales and marketing see the changes in the demand for their product, while executives with a background in information technology may more readily perceive the changes in the technology the company is using. Selective perception may perpetuate stereotypes, because we are less likely to notice events that go against our beliefs. A person who believes that men drive better than women may be more likely to notice women driving poorly than men driving poorly. As a result, a stereotype is maintained because information to the contrary may not reach our brain.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_s03_p06">Let’s say we noticed information that goes against our beliefs. What then? Unfortunately, this is no guarantee that we will modify our beliefs and prejudices. First, when we see examples that go against our stereotypes, we tend to come up with subcategories. For example, when people who believe that women are more cooperative see a female who is assertive, they may classify this person as a “career woman.” Therefore, the example to the contrary does not violate the stereotype, and instead is explained as an exception to the rule.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_082">Higgins, E. T., &amp; Bargh, J. A. (1987). Social cognition and social perception. <em class="emphasis">Annual Review of Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">38</em>, 369–425.</span> Second, we may simply discount the information. In one study, people who were either in favor of or opposed to the death penalty were shown two studies, one showing benefits from the death penalty and the other discounting any benefits. People rejected the study that went against their belief as methodologically inferior and actually reinforced the belief in their original position even more.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_083">Lord, C. G., Ross, L., &amp; Lepper, M. R. (1979). Biased assimilation and attitude polarization: The effects of prior theories on subsequently considered evidence. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">37</em>, 2098–2109.</span> In other words, trying to debunk people’s beliefs or previously established opinions with data may not necessarily help.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_s03_p07">One other perceptual tendency that may affect work behavior is that of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">first impressions</a><span class="glossdef">Initial thoughts and perceptions we form about people, which tend to be stable and resilient to contrary information.</span></span>. The first impressions we form about people tend to have a lasting impact. In fact, first impressions, once formed, are surprisingly resilient to contrary information. Even if people are told that the first impressions were caused by inaccurate information, people hold onto them to a certain degree. The reason is that, once we form first impressions, they become independent of the evidence that created them.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_084">Ross, L., Lepper, M. R., &amp; Hubbard, M. (1975). Perseverance in self-perception and social perception: Biased attributional processes in the debriefing paradigm. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">32</em>, 880–892.</span> Any information we receive to the contrary does not serve the purpose of altering the original impression. Imagine the first day you met your colleague Anne. She treated you in a rude manner and when you asked for her help, she brushed you off. You may form the belief that she is a rude and unhelpful person. Later, you may hear that her mother is very sick and she is very stressed. In reality she may have been unusually stressed on the day you met her. If you had met her on a different day, you could have thought that she is a really nice person who is unusually stressed these days. But chances are your impression that she is rude and unhelpful will not change even when you hear about her mother. Instead, this new piece of information will be added to the first one: She is rude, unhelpful, and her mother is sick. Being aware of this tendency and consciously opening your mind to new information may protect you against some of the downsides of this bias. Also, it would be to your advantage to pay careful attention to the first impressions you create, particularly during job interviews.</p>

            <h3 class="title">OB Toolbox: How Can I Make a Great First Impression in the Job Interview?</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_s03_p08">A job interview is your first step to getting the job of your dreams. It is also a social interaction in which your actions during the first 5 minutes will determine the impression you make. Here are some tips to help you create a positive first impression.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_s03_l01">
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Your first opportunity to make a great impression starts even before the interview, the moment you send your résumé</em>. Be sure that you send your résumé to the correct people, and spell the name of the contact person correctly! Make sure that your résumé looks professional and is free from typos and grammar problems. Have someone else read it before you hit the send button or mail it.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be prepared for the interview</em>. Many interviews have some standard questions such as “tell me about yourself” or “why do you want to work here?” Be ready to answer these questions. Prepare answers highlighting your skills and accomplishments, and practice your message. Better yet, practice an interview with a friend. Practicing your answers will prevent you from regretting your answers or finding a better answer after the interview is over!</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Research the company</em>. If you know a lot about the company and the job in question, you will come out as someone who is really interested in the job. If you ask basic questions such as “what does this company do?” you will not be taken as a serious candidate. Visit the company’s Web site as well as others, and learn as much about the company and the job as you can.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">When you are invited for an office interview, be sure to dress properly</em>. Like it or not, the manner you dress is a big part of the impression you make. Dress properly for the job and company in question. In many jobs, wearing professional clothes, such as a suit, is expected. In some information technology jobs, it may be more proper to wear clean and neat business casual clothes (such as khakis and a pressed shirt) as opposed to dressing formally. Do some investigation about what is suitable. Whatever the norm is, make sure that your clothes fit well and are clean and neat.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be on time to the interview</em>. Being late will show that you either don’t care about the interview or you are not very reliable. While waiting for the interview, don’t forget that your interview has already started. As soon as you enter the company’s parking lot, every person you see on the way or talk to may be a potential influence over the decision maker. Act professionally and treat everyone nicely.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">During the interview, be polite</em>. Use correct grammar, show eagerness and enthusiasm, and watch your body language. From your handshake to your posture, your body is communicating whether you are the right person for the job!</li>

Do you give him the benefit of the doubt and place the blame on the difficulty of the project? Or do you think that he is irresponsible? Our behavior is a function of our perceptions. More specifically, when we observe others behave in a certain way, we ask ourselves a fundamental question: Why? Why did he fail to meet the deadline? Why did Mary get the promotion? Why did Mark help you when you needed help? The answer we give is the key to understanding our subsequent behavior. If you believe that Mark helped you because he is a nice person, your action will be different from your response if you think that Mark helped you because your boss pressured him to.</p>

Erin does not usually complain in other classes (high distinctiveness). Erin usually does not complain in finance class (low consistency). In this situation, you are likely to make an external attribution, such as thinking that finance homework is difficult. On the other hand, let’s assume that Erin is the only person complaining (low consensus). Erin complains in a variety of situations (low distinctiveness), and every time she is in finance, she complains (high consistency). In this situation, you are likely to make an internal attribution such as thinking that Erin is a negative person.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_085">Kelley, H. H. (1967).

In other words, when making attributions, we do not always look at the situation objectively. For example, our overall relationship is a factor.

When faced with poor performance, such as missing a deadline, we are more likely to punish the person if an internal attribution is made (such as “the person being unreliable”). In the same situation, if we make an external attribution (such as “the timeline was unreasonable”), instead of punishing the person we might extend the deadline or assign more help to the person. If we feel that someone’s failure is due to external causes, we may feel empathy toward the person and even offer help.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_088">LePine, J. A., &amp; Van Dyne, L.

            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_s04_p10">Perception is how we make sense of our environment in response to environmental stimuli. While perceiving our surroundings, we go beyond the objective information available to us, and our perception is affected by our values, needs, and emotions. There are many biases that affect human perception of objects, self, and others. When perceiving the physical environment, we fill in gaps and extrapolate from the available information. We also contrast physical objects to their surroundings and may perceive something as bigger, smaller, slower, or faster than it really is. In self-perception, we may commit the self-enhancement or self-effacement bias, depending on our personality. We also overestimate how much we are like other people. When perceiving others, stereotypes infect our behavior. Stereotypes may lead to self-fulfilling prophecies. Stereotypes are perpetuated because of our tendency to pay selective attention to aspects of the environment and ignore information inconsistent with our beliefs. When perceiving others, the attributions we make will determine how we respond to the situation. Understanding the perception process gives us clues to understand human behavior.</p>
