        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_p01">There are three types of communication, including: verbal communication involving listening to a person to understand the meaning of a message, written communication in which a message is read, and nonverbal communication involving observing a person and inferring meaning. Let’s start with verbal communication, which is the most common form of communication.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Verbal Communication</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p01">Verbal communications in business take place over the phone or in person. The medium of the message is oral. Let’s return to our printer cartridge example. This time, the message is being conveyed from the sender (the manager) to the receiver (an employee named Bill) by telephone. We’ve already seen how the manager’s request to Bill (“Buy more printer toner cartridges!”) can go awry. Now let’s look at how the same message can travel successfully from sender to receiver.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p02">Manager (speaking on the phone): “Good morning Bill!”</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p04">Manager: “Your division’s numbers are looking great.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p05">(<em class="emphasis">The manager’s recognition of Bill’s role in a winning team further personalizes and emotionalizes the conversation</em>.)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p06">Manager: “Our next step is to order more printer toner cartridges. Would you place an order for 1,000 printer toner cartridges with Jones Computer Supplies? Our budget for this purchase is $30,000, and the printer toner cartridges need to be here by Wednesday afternoon.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p07">(<em class="emphasis">The manager breaks down the task into several steps. Each step consists of a specific task, time frame, quantity, or goal</em>.)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p08">Bill: “Sure thing! I’ll call Jones Computer Supplies and order 1,000 more printer toner cartridges, not exceeding a total of $30,000, to be here by Wednesday afternoon.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p09">(<em class="emphasis">Bill, a model employee, repeats what he has heard. This is the feedback portion of the communication. Feedback helps him recognize any confusion he may have had hearing the manager’s message. Feedback also helps the manager hear if she has communicated the message correctly</em>.)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p10"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Storytelling</a><span class="glossdef">A narrative account of an event or events.</span></span> has been shown to be an effective form of verbal communication that serves an important organizational function by helping to construct common meanings for individuals within the organization. Stories can help clarify key values and also help demonstrate how certain tasks are performed within an organization. Story frequency, strength, and tone are related to higher organizational commitment.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_025">McCarthy, J. F. (2008).

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p11">While the process may be the same, high stakes communications require more planning, reflection, and skill than normal day-to-day interactions at work. Examples of high stakes communication events include asking for a raise or presenting a business plan to a venture capitalist. In addition to these events, there are also many times in our professional lives when we have <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">crucial conversations</a><span class="glossdef">Discussions in which the stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions run strong.</span></span>, which are defined as discussions in which not only are the stakes high, but also the opinions vary and emotions run strong.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_027">Patterson, K., Grenny, J., McMillan, R., &amp; Switzler, A. (2002). <em class="emphasis">Crucial conversations: Tools for talking when stakes are high</em>. New York: McGraw-Hill.</span> One of the most consistent recommendations from communications experts is to work toward using <em class="emphasis">“and”</em> instead of <em class="emphasis">“but”</em> when communicating under these circumstances. In addition, be aware of your communication style and practice being flexible; it is under stressful situations that communication styles can become the most rigid.</p>

<em class="emphasis">Be the first to say hello</em>. Use your name in your introduction, in case others have forgotten it.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Think before you speak</em>. Our impulse is often to imitate movies by offering fast, witty replies in conversation. In the real world, a careful silence can make us sound more intelligent and prevent mistakes.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be receptive to new ideas</em>. If you disagree with another person’s opinion, saying, “Tell me more,” can be a more useful way of moving forward than saying, “That’s stupid!”</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Repeat someone’s name to yourself and then aloud, when being introduced</em>. The form of the name you use may vary. First names work with peers. Mr. or Ms. is common when meeting superiors in business.</li>

<em class="emphasis">Use eye contact</em>. Eye contact shows that you are engaged. Also, be sure to smile and make sure your body language matches your message.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Mirror the other person</em>. Occasionally repeat what they’ve said in your own words. “You mean… ?”</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Have an exit strategy ready</em>. Ideal conversations are brief, leaving others wanting more.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be prepared</em>. Before beginning a conversation, have three simple facts about yourself and four questions about someone else in mind.</li>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Written Communication</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p01">In contrast to verbal communications, which are oral, written business communications are <em class="emphasis">printed messages</em>. Examples of written communications include memos, proposals, e-mails, letters, training manuals, and operating policies. They may be printed on paper or appear on the screen. Written communication is often asynchronous. That is, the sender can write a message that the receiver can read at any time, unlike a conversation that is carried on in real time. A written communication can also be read by many people (such as all employees in a department or all customers). It’s a “one-to-many” communication, as opposed to a one-to-one conversation. There are exceptions, of course: A voice mail is an oral message that is asynchronous. Conference calls and speeches are oral one-to-many communications, and e-mails can have only one recipient or many.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p02">Normally, a verbal communication takes place in real time. Written communication, by contrast, can be constructed over a longer period of time. It also can be collaborative. Multiple people can contribute to the content on one document before that document is sent to the intended audience.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p03">Verbal and written communications have different strengths and weaknesses. In business, the decision to communicate verbally or in written form can be a powerful one. As we’ll see below, each style of communication has particular strengths and pitfalls. When determining whether to communicate verbally or in writing, ask yourself: <em class="emphasis">Do I want to convey facts or feelings</em>? Verbal communications are a better way to convey feelings. Written communications do a better job of conveying facts.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p04">Picture a manager making a speech to a team of 20 employees. The manager is speaking at a normal pace. The employees appear interested. But how much information is being transmitted? Probably not as much as the speaker believes. The fact is that humans listen much faster than they speak. The average public speaker communicates at a speed of about 125 words a minute, and that pace sounds fine to the audience. (In fact, anything faster than that probably would sound unusual. To put that figure in perspective, someone having an excited conversation speaks at about 150 words a minute.) Based on these numbers, we could assume that the audience has more than enough time to take in each word the speaker delivers, which actually creates a problem. The average person in the audience can hear 400 to 500 words a minute.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_028">Lee, D., &amp; Hatesohl, D. <em class="emphasis">Listening: Our most used communication skill</em>.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p05">As you can see, oral communication is the most often used form of communication, but it is also an inherently flawed medium for conveying specific facts. Listeners’ minds wander. It’s nothing personal—in fact, it’s a completely normal psychological occurrence. In business, once we understand this fact, we can make more intelligent communication choices based on the kind of information we want to convey.</p>

According to the National Commission on Writing, 67% of salaried employees in large American companies and professional state employees have some kind of writing responsibility. Half of responding companies reported that they take writing into consideration when hiring professional employees, and 91% always take writing into account when hiring.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_029">Flink, H.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p07">Here are some tips on writing well. Thomas Jefferson summed up the rules of writing well with this idea: “Don’t use two words when one will do.” Put another way, half the words can have twice the impact. One of the oldest myths in business is that writing more will make us sound more important. The opposite is true. Leaders who can communicate simply and clearly project a stronger image than those who write a lot but say nothing.</p>

Surprisingly, what you <em class="emphasis">don’t say</em> can be even more important. Research shows that nonverbal cues can also affect whether or not you get a job offer. Judges examining videotapes of actual applicants were able to assess the social skills of job candidates with the sound turned off. They watched the rate of gesturing, time spent talking, and formality of dress to determine which candidates would be the most socially successful on the job.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_030">Gifford, R., Ng, C.

According to one study, only 7% of a receiver’s comprehension of a message is based on the sender’s actual words, 38% is based on paralanguage (the tone, pace, and volume of speech), and 55% is based on <em class="emphasis">nonverbal cues</em> (body language).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_031">Mehrabian, A.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s03_p05">Now you can see how changing the tone of voice in a conversation can incite or diffuse a misunderstanding. For another example, imagine that you’re a customer interested in opening a new bank account. At one bank, the bank officer is dressed neatly. She looks you in the eye when she speaks. Her tone is friendly. Her words are easy to understand, yet professional sounding. “Thank you for considering Bank of the East Coast. We appreciate this opportunity and would love to explore ways that we can work together to help your business grow,” she says with a friendly smile. At the second bank, the bank officer’s tie is stained. He looks over your head and down at his desk as he speaks. He shifts in his seat and fidgets with his hands. His words say, “Thank you for considering Bank of the West Coast. We appreciate this opportunity and would love to explore ways that we can work together to help you business grow,” but he mumbles his words, and his voice conveys no enthusiasm or warmth. Which bank would you choose? The speaker’s body language must match his or her words. If a sender’s words and body language don’t match—if a sender smiles while telling a sad tale, for example—the mismatch between verbal and nonverbal cues can cause a receiver to actively dislike the sender.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s03_p06">Following are a few examples of nonverbal cues that can support or detract from a sender’s message.</p>

Sincerity is vital for effective communication. In some cultures, a firm handshake, given with a warm, dry hand, is a great way to establish trust. A weak, clammy handshake might convey a lack of trustworthiness. Gnawing one’s lip conveys uncertainty. A direct smile conveys confidence.</p>

Happiness is associated with an upturned mouth and slightly closed eyes; fear with an open mouth and wide-eyed stare. Shifty eyes and pursed lips convey a lack of trustworthiness. The impact of facial expressions in conversation is instantaneous. Our brains may register them as “a feeling” about someone’s character. For this reason, it is important to consider how we appear in business as well as what we say. The muscles of our faces convey our emotions. We can send a silent message without saying a word. A change in facial expression can change our emotional state. Before an interview, for example, if we focus on feeling confident, our face will convey that confidence to an interviewer. Adopting a smile (even if we’re feeling stressed) can reduce the body’s stress levels.</p>

Head up, back straight (but not rigid) implies an upright character. In interview situations, experts advise mirroring an interviewer’s tendency to lean in and settle back in a seat. The subtle repetition of the other person’s posture conveys that we are listening and responding.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s02_p04">Like face-to-face and telephone conversations, videoconferencing has high information richness, because receivers and senders can see or hear beyond just the words that are used—they can see the sender’s body language or hear the tone of their voice. Handheld devices, blogs, and written letters and memos offer medium-rich channels, because they convey words and pictures or photos. Formal written documents, such as legal documents and budget spreadsheets, convey the least richness, because the format is often rigid and standardized. As a result, the tone of the message is often lost.</p>

As we saw in the chart above, e-mail is a medium-rich channel. It can convey facts quickly. But when it comes to emotion, e-mail’s flaws make it a far less desirable choice than oral communication—the 55% of nonverbal cues that make a conversation comprehensible to a listener are missing. Researchers also note that e-mail readers don’t pick up on sarcasm and other tonal aspects of writing as much as the writer believes they will.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_041">Kruger, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s02_p07">The sender may believe that certain emotional signifiers have been included in a message. But, with written words alone, those signifiers are not there. This gap between the form and content of e-mail inspired the rise of emoticons—symbols that offer clues to the emotional side of the words in each message. Generally speaking, however, emoticons are not considered professional in business communication.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s02_p08">You might feel uncomfortable conveying an emotionally laden message verbally, especially when the message contains unwanted news. Sending an e-mail to your staff that there will be no bonuses this year may seem easier than breaking the bad news face-to-face, but that doesn’t mean that e-mail is an effective or appropriate way to break this kind of news. When the message is emotional, the sender should use verbal communication. Indeed, a good rule of thumb is that more emotionally laden messages require more thought in the choice of channel and how they are communicated.</p>

The supervisor, who has a lower status within the organization, is likely to pay close attention to the message. The same information conveyed in the opposite direction, however, might not get the attention it deserves. The message would be filtered by the senior manager’s perception of priorities and urgencies.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s04_p01">External communications deliver specific businesses messages to individuals outside an organization. They may announce changes in staff or strategy, earnings, and more. The goal of an external communication is to create a specific message that the receiver will understand and share with others. Examples of external communications include the following.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Press Releases</h2>

These receivers, it is hoped, will share the message with others. In time, as the message is passed along, it should <em class="emphasis">appear</em> to be independent of the sender, creating the illusion of an independently generated consumer trend, public opinion, and so on.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s04_s01_p02">The message of a public relations effort may be <em class="emphasis">b2b</em> (business to business), <em class="emphasis">b2c</em> (business to consumer), or media related. The message can take different forms. Press releases try to convey a newsworthy message, real or manufactured. It may be constructed like a news item, inviting editors or reporters to reprint the message in part or as a whole, with or without acknowledgement of the sender’s identity. Public relations campaigns create messages over time through contests, special events, trade shows, and media interviews in addition to press releases.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Ads</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s04_s02_p01">Advertising places external business messages before target receivers through media buys. A media buy is a fee that is paid to a television network, Web site, magazine, and so on by an advertiser to insert an advertisement. The fee is based on the perceived value of the audience who watches, reads, listens to, or frequents the space where the ad will appear.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s04_s02_p02">In recent years, receivers have begun to filter advertiser’s messages. This phenomenon is perceived to be a result of the large amount of ads the average person sees each day and a growing level of consumer wariness of paid messaging. Advertisers, in turn, are trying to create alternative forms of advertising that receivers won’t filter. The <em class="emphasis">advertorial</em> is one example of an external communication that combines the look of an article with the focused message of an ad. Product placements in videos, movies, and games are other ways that advertisers strive to reach receivers with commercial messages.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Web Pages</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s04_s03_p01">A Web page’s external communication can combine elements of public relations, advertising, and editorial content, reaching receivers on multiple levels and in multiple ways. Banner ads, blogs, and advertiser-driven “click-through” areas are just a few of the elements that allow a business to deliver a message to a receiver online. The perceived flexibility of online communications can impart a less formal (and therefore, more believable) quality to an external communication. A message relayed in a daily blog post, for example, will reach a receiver differently than if it is delivered in an annual report. The popularity and power of blogs is growing, with 11% of <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 500 companies having official blogs (up from 4% in 2005). In fact, blogs have become so important to companies such as Coca-Cola Company, Eastman Kodak Company, and Marriott International Inc. that they have created official positions within their organizations titled “chief blogging officer.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_045">Chief blogging officer title catching on with corporations. (2008, May 1). <em class="emphasis">Workforce Management</em>. Retrieved July 2, 2008, from <a class="link" href="http://www.workforce.com/section/00/article/25/50/77.html">http://www.workforce.com/section/00/article/25/50/77.html</a>.</span> The “real-time” quality of Web communications may appeal to receivers who might filter out traditional ads and public relations messages because of their “prefab” quality. Despite a “spontaneous” feel, many online pages can be revisited many times in a single day. For this reason, clear and accurate external communications are as vital for online use as they are in traditional media.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s04_s04_p01">Customer communications can include letters, catalogs, direct mail, e-mails, text messages, and telemarketing messages. Some receivers automatically filter these types of bulk messages. Others will be receptive. The key to a successful external communication to customers is to convey a business message in a personally compelling way—dramatic news, a money-saving coupon, and so forth.</p>

Surprisingly, 55% of face-to-face communication comes from nonverbal cues such as tone or body language. Different communication channels are more or less effective at transmitting different kinds of information. In addition, communication flows in different directions within organizations.</p>
