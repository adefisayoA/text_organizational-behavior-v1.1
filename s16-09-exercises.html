        <h3 class="title">Ethical Dilemma</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s07_p01">You are currently a department manager and Jim is your “trusted assistant.” You have very similar working styles, and you went to the same college and worked in the insurance industry for several years. Before working in this company, you both worked at a different company and you have this shared history with him. You can trust him to come to your aid, support you in your decisions, and be loyal to you. Because of your trust in him, you do not supervise his work closely, and you give him a lot of leeway in how he structures his work. He sometimes chooses to work from home, and he has flexibility in his work hours, which is unusual in the department.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s07_p02">Now you decided to promote him to be the assistant department manager. However, when you shared this opinion with someone else in the department, you realized that this could be a problem. Apparently, Jim is not liked by his colleagues in the department and is known as an “impression manager.” Others view him as a slacker when you are not around, and the fact that he gets the first pick in schedules and gets the choice assignments causes a lot of frustration on the part of others. They feel that you are playing favorites.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s07_p03">Authentic leaders have high levels of self-awareness, and their behavior is driven by their core personal values.

        <h3 class="title">Group Exercise</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s07_p05">You are charged with hiring a manager for a fast-food restaurant. The operations within the store are highly standardized, and employees have very specific job descriptions. The person will be in charge of managing around 30 employees. There is a high degree of turnover among employees, so retention will be an important priority. Most employees who work in the restaurant are young with low levels of work experience, and few of them view the restaurant business as a full-time career. The atmosphere in the restaurant has a fast pace. In this company, managers are often promoted from within, and this position is an exception. Therefore, the incoming manager may not expect a warm welcome from employees who were passed over for a promotion, as well as their colleagues. Finally, the position power of the manager will be somewhat limited because employees are unionized. Therefore, the manager will have limited opportunities for distributing pay raises or bonuses.</p>
        <p class="simpara">Discussion Questions</p>

            <li>Identify the leadership traits and behaviors that are desirable for this position.</li>
            <li>Design an approach to selecting this person. Which methods of employee selection would you use? Why?</li>
            <li>Develop interview questions to be used in hiring this manager. Your questions should be aimed at predicting the leadership capabilities of the person in question.</li>
