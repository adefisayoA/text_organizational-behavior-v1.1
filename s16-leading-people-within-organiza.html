One caveat is important here: Leaders do not rely on the use of force to influence people. Instead, people willingly adopt the leader’s goal as their own goal.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_p07">What makes leaders effective? What distinguishes people who are perceived as leaders from those who are not perceived as leaders? More importantly, how do we train future leaders and improve our own leadership ability? These are important questions that have attracted scholarly attention in the past several decades. In this chapter, we will review the history of leadership studies and summarize the major findings relating to these important questions. Around the world, we view leaders as at least partly responsible for their team or company’s success and failure. Company CEOs are paid millions of dollars in salaries and stock options with the assumption that they hold their company’s future in their hands. In politics, education, sports, profit and nonprofit sectors, the influence of leaders over the behaviors of individuals and organizations is rarely questioned. When people and organizations fail, managers and CEOs are often viewed as responsible. Some people criticize the assumption that leadership always matters and call this belief “the romance of leadership.” However, research evidence pointing to the importance of leaders for organizational success is accumulating.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_001">Hogan, R., Curphy, G.

            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12a_s01_p01">She is among the top 100 most influential people according to <em class="emphasis">Time</em> magazine’s 2008 list. She is also number 5 in <em class="emphasis">Forbes</em>’s “Most Influential Women in the World” (2007), number 1 in <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>’s “50 Most Powerful Women” (2006), and number 22 in <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>’s “25 Most Powerful People in Business” (2007). The lists go on and on. To those familiar with her work and style, this should come as no surprise: Even before she became the CEO of PepsiCo Inc. (NYSE: PEP) in 2006, she was one of the most powerful executives at PepsiCo and one of the two candidates being groomed for the coveted CEO position. Born in Chennai, India, Nooyi graduated from Yale’s School of Management and worked in companies such as the Boston Consulting Group Inc., Motorola Inc., and ABB Inc. She also led an all-girls rock band in high school, but that is a different story.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12a_s01_p02">What makes her one of the top leaders in the business world today? To start with, she has a clear vision for PepsiCo, which seems to be the right vision for the company at this point in time. Her vision is framed under the term “performance with purpose,” which is based on two key ideas: tackling the obesity epidemic by improving the nutritional status of PepsiCo products and making PepsiCo an environmentally sustainable company. She is an inspirational speaker and rallies people around her vision for the company. She has the track record to show that she means what she says. She was instrumental in PepsiCo’s acquisition of the food conglomerate Quaker Oats Company and the juice maker Tropicana Products Inc., both of which have healthy product lines. She is bent on reducing PepsiCo’s reliance on high-sugar, high-calorie beverages, and she made sure that PepsiCo removed trans fats from all its products before its competitors. On the environmental side, she is striving for a net zero impact on the environment. Among her priorities are plans to reduce the plastic used in beverage bottles and find biodegradable packaging solutions for PepsiCo products. Her vision is long term and could be risky for short-term earnings, but it is also timely and important.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12a_s01_p03">Those who work with her feel challenged by her high-performance standards and expectation of excellence. She is not afraid to give people negative feedback—and with humor, too. She pushes people until they come up with a solution to a problem and does not take “I don’t know” for an answer. For example, she insisted that her team find an alternative to the expensive palm oil and did not stop urging them forward until the alternative arrived: rice bran oil.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12a_s01_p04">Nooyi is well liked and respected because she listens to those around her, even when they disagree with her. Her background cuts across national boundaries, which gives her a true appreciation for diversity, and she expects those around her to bring their values to work. In fact, when she graduated from college, she wore a sari to a job interview at Boston Consulting, where she got the job. She is an unusually collaborative person in the top suite of a <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 500 company, and she seeks help and information when she needs it. She has friendships with three ex-CEOs of PepsiCo who serve as her informal advisors, and when she was selected to the top position at PepsiCo, she made sure that her rival for the position got a pay raise and was given influence in the company so she did not lose him. She says that the best advice she received was from her father, who taught her to assume that people have good intentions. Nooyi notes that expecting people to have good intentions helps her prevent misunderstandings and show empathy for them. It seems that she is a role model to other business leaders around the world, and PepsiCo is well positioned to tackle the challenges the future may bring.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s01_p01">The earliest approach to the study of leadership sought to identify a set of traits that distinguished leaders from nonleaders. What were the personality characteristics and the physical and psychological attributes of people who are viewed as leaders? Because of the problems in measurement of personality traits at the time, different studies used different measures. By 1940, researchers concluded that the search for leadership-defining traits was futile. In recent years, though, after the advances in personality literature such as the development of the Big Five personality framework, researchers have had more success in identifying traits that predict leadership.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_002">House, R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s01_s02_p02">For example, extraversion is related to leadership. <em class="emphasis">Extraverts</em> are sociable, assertive, and energetic people. They enjoy interacting with others in their environment and demonstrate self-confidence. Because they are both dominant and sociable in their environment, they emerge as leaders in a wide variety of situations. Out of all personality traits, extraversion has the strongest relationship with both leader emergence and leader effectiveness. This is not to say that all effective leaders are extraverts, but you are more likely to find extraverts in leadership positions. An example of an introverted leader is Jim Buckmaster, the CEO of Craigslist. He is known as an introvert, and he admits to not having meetings because he does not like them.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_009">Buckmaster, J. (2008, May). How does he manage? Classified website boss. <em class="emphasis">Management Today</em>, 15.</span> Research shows that another personality trait related to leadership is <em class="emphasis">conscientiousness</em>. Conscientious people are organized, take initiative, and demonstrate persistence in their endeavors. Conscientious people are more likely to emerge as leaders and be effective in that role. Finally, people who have <em class="emphasis">openness to experience</em>—those who demonstrate originality, creativity, and are open to trying new things—tend to emerge as leaders and also be quite effective.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Self-Esteem</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s01_s03_p01">Self-esteem is not one of the Big Five personality traits, but it is an important aspect of one’s personality. The degree to which a person is at peace with oneself and has an overall positive assessment of one’s self worth and capabilities seem to be relevant to whether someone is viewed as a leader. Leaders with high self-esteem support their subordinates more and, when punishment is administered, they punish more effectively.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_010">Atwater, L.

Self-esteem: Relationship with leader behavior perceptions as moderated by the duration of the superior-subordinate dyad association. <em class="emphasis">Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, <em class="emphasis">10</em>, 51–59.</span> It is possible that those with high self-esteem have greater levels of self-confidence and this affects their image in the eyes of their followers. Self-esteem may also explain the relationship between some physical attributes and leader emergence. For example, research shows a strong relationship between being tall and being viewed as a leader (as well as one’s career success over life). It is proposed that self-esteem may be the key mechanism linking height to being viewed as a leader, because people who are taller are also found to have higher self-esteem and therefore may project greater levels of charisma as well as confidence to their followers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_011">Judge, T.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s01_s04_p03">Despite problems in trait approaches, these findings can still be useful to managers and companies. For example, knowing about leader traits helps organizations select the right people into positions of responsibility. The key to benefiting from the findings of trait researchers is to be aware that not all traits are equally effective in predicting leadership potential across all circumstances. Some organizational situations allow leader traits to make a greater difference.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_015">House, R. J., &amp; Aditya, R. N. (1997). The social scientific study of leadership: Quo Vadis? <em class="emphasis">Journal of Management</em>, <em class="emphasis">23</em>, 409–473.</span> For example, in small, entrepreneurial organizations where leaders have a lot of leeway to determine their own behavior, the type of traits leaders have may make a difference in leadership potential. In large, bureaucratic, and rule-bound organizations such as the government and the military, a leader’s traits may have less to do with how the person behaves and whether the person is a successful leader.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_016">Judge, T. A., Bono, J. E., Ilies, R., &amp; Gerhardt, M. W. (2002). Personality and leadership: A qualitative and quantitative review. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">87</em>, 765–780.</span> Moreover, some traits become relevant in specific circumstances. For example, bravery is likely to be a key characteristic in military leaders, but not necessarily in business leaders. Scholars now conclude that instead of trying to identify a few traits that distinguish leaders from nonleaders, it is important to identify the conditions under which different traits affect a leader’s performance, as well as whether a person emerges as a leader.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_017">Hackman, J.

            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s01_s04_p04">Many studies searched for a limited set of personal attributes, or traits, which would make someone be viewed as a leader and be successful as a leader. Some traits that are consistently related to leadership include intelligence (both mental ability and emotional intelligence), personality (extraversion, conscientiousness, openness to experience, self-esteem), and integrity. The main limitation of the trait approach was that it ignored the situation in which leadership occurred. Therefore, it is more useful to specify the conditions under which different traits are needed.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s02_s01_p01">When trait researchers became disillusioned in the 1940s, their attention turned to studying leader behaviors. What did effective leaders actually do? Which behaviors made them perceived as leaders? Which behaviors increased their success? To answer these questions, researchers at Ohio State University and the University of Michigan used many different techniques, such as observing leaders in laboratory settings as well as surveying them. This research stream led to the discovery of two broad categories of behaviors: task-oriented behaviors (sometimes called <strong class="emphasis bold">initiating structure</strong>) and people-oriented behaviors (also called <strong class="emphasis bold">consideration</strong>). <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Task-oriented leader behaviors</a><span class="glossdef">Structuring the roles of subordinates, providing them with instructions, and behaving in ways that will increase the performance of the group (also called initiating structure).</span></span> involve structuring the roles of subordinates, providing them with instructions, and behaving in ways that will increase the performance of the group. Task-oriented behaviors are directives given to employees to get things done and to ensure that organizational goals are met. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">People-oriented leader behaviors</a><span class="glossdef">Showing concern for employee feelings and treating employees with respect (also called consideration).</span></span> include showing concern for employee feelings and treating employees with respect. People-oriented leaders genuinely care about the well-being of their employees, and they demonstrate their concern in their actions and decisions. At the time, researchers thought that these two categories of behaviors were the keys to the puzzle of leadership.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_018">See House, R. J., &amp; Aditya, R. N. (1997). The social scientific study of leadership: Quo Vadis? <em class="emphasis">Journal of Management</em>, <em class="emphasis">23</em>, 409–473.</span> However, research did not support the argument that demonstrating both of these behaviors would necessarily make leaders effective.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_019">Nystrom, P. C. (1978). Managers and the hi-hi leader myth. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal</em>, <em class="emphasis">21</em>, 325–331.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s02_s01_p02">When we look at the overall findings regarding these leader behaviors, it seems that both types of behaviors, in the aggregate, are beneficial to organizations, but for different purposes. For example, when leaders demonstrate people-oriented behaviors, employees tend to be more satisfied and react more positively. However, when leaders are task oriented, productivity tends to be a bit higher.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_020">Judge, T. A., Piccolo, R. F., &amp; Ilies, R. (2004). The forgotten ones?

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s02_s02_p01">Another question behavioral researchers focused on involved how leaders actually make decisions and the influence of decision-making styles on leader effectiveness and employee reactions.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s02_s02_p02">As with other lines of research on leadership, research did not identify one decision-making style as the best. It seems that the effectiveness of the style the leader is using depends on the circumstances. A review of the literature shows that when leaders use more democratic or participative decision-making styles, employees tend to be more satisfied; however, the effects on decision quality or employee productivity are weaker. Moreover, instead of expecting to be involved in every single decision, employees seem to care more about the overall participativeness of the organizational climate.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_023">Miller, K. I., &amp; Monge, P. R. (1986). Participation, satisfaction, and productivity: A meta-analytic review. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal</em>, <em class="emphasis">29</em>, 727–753.</span> Different types of employees may also expect different levels of involvement. In a research organization, scientists viewed democratic leadership most favorably and authoritarian leadership least favorably,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_024">Baumgartel, H. (1957).

            <h3 class="title">Leadership Assumptions about Human Nature</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s02_s02_p04">Why do some managers believe that the only way to manage employees is to force and coerce them to work while others adopt a more humane approach? Douglas McGregor, an MIT Sloan School of Management professor, believed that a manager’s actions toward employees were dictated by having one of two basic sets of assumptions about employee attitudes. His two contrasting categories, outlined in his 1960 book, <em class="emphasis">The Human Side of Enterprise</em>, are known as Theory X and Theory Y.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s02_s02_p05">According to McGregor, some managers subscribe to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Theory X</a><span class="glossdef">A theory of human nature which assumes that employees are lazy, do not enjoy working, and will avoid expending energy on work whenever possible.</span></span>. The main assumptions of Theory X managers are that employees are lazy, do not enjoy working, and will avoid expending energy on work whenever possible. For a manager, this theory suggests employees need to be forced to work through any number of control mechanisms ranging from threats to actual punishments. Because of the assumptions they make about human nature, Theory X managers end up establishing rigid work environments. Theory X also assumes employees completely lack ambition. As a result, managers must take full responsibility for their subordinates’ actions, as these employees will never take initiative outside of regular job duties to accomplish tasks.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s02_s02_p06">In contrast, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Theory Y</a><span class="glossdef">A theory of human nature which assumes that employees are not lazy, can enjoy work, and will put effort into furthering organizational goals.</span></span> paints a much more positive view of employees’ attitudes and behaviors. Under Theory Y, employees are not lazy, can enjoy work, and will put effort into furthering organizational goals. Because these managers can assume that employees will act in the best interests of the organization given the chance, Theory Y managers allow employees autonomy and help them become committed to particular goals. They tend to adopt a more supportive role, often focusing on maintaining a work environment in which employees can be innovative and prosperous within their roles.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s02_s03_p01">Behavioral approaches, similar to trait approaches, fell out of favor because they neglected the environment in which behaviors are demonstrated. The hope of the researchers was that the identified behaviors would predict leadership under all circumstances, but it may be unrealistic to expect that a given set of behaviors would work under all circumstances. What makes a high school principal effective on the job may be very different from what makes a military leader effective, which would be different from behaviors creating success in small or large business enterprises. It turns out that specifying the conditions under which these behaviors are more effective may be a better approach.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s02_s03_p02">When researchers failed to identify a set of traits that would distinguish effective from ineffective leaders, research attention turned to the study of leader behaviors. Leaders may demonstrate task-oriented and people-oriented behaviors. Both seem to be related to important outcomes, with task-oriented behaviors more strongly relating to leader effectiveness and people-oriented behaviors leading to employee satisfaction. Leaders can also make decisions using authoritarian, democratic, or laissez-faire styles. While laissez-faire has certain downsides, there is no best style, and the effectiveness of each style seems to vary across situations. Because of the inconsistency of results, researchers realized the importance of the context in which leadership occurs, which paved the way to contingency theories of leadership.</p>

Instead, a better question might be: Under which conditions are certain leadership styles more effective? After the disappointing results of trait and behavioral approaches, several scholars developed leadership theories that specifically incorporated the role of the environment. Specifically, researchers started following a contingency approach to leadership—rather than trying to identify traits or behaviors that would be effective under all conditions, the attention moved toward specifying the situations under which different styles would be effective.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Fiedler’s Contingency Theory</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s03_s01_p01">The earliest and one of the most influential contingency theories was developed by Frederick Fiedler.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_029">Fiedler, F. (1967). <em class="emphasis">A theory of leadership effectiveness</em>. New York: McGraw-Hill; Fiedler, F. E. (1964). A contingency model of leader effectiveness. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Advances in experimental social psychology, vol. 1</em> (pp. 149–190). New York: Academic Press.</span> According to the theory, a leader’s style is measured by a scale called Least Preferred Coworker scale (LPC). People who are filling out this survey are asked to think of a person who is their least preferred coworker. Then, they rate this person in terms of how friendly, nice, and cooperative this person is. Imagine someone you did not enjoy working with. Can you describe this person in positive terms? In other words, if you can say that the person you hated working with was still a nice person, you would have a high LPC score. This means that you have a people-oriented personality, and you can separate your liking of a person from your ability to work with that person. On the other hand, if you think that the person you hated working with was also someone you did not like on a personal level, you would have a low LPC score. To you, being unable to work with someone would mean that you also dislike that person. In other words, you are a task-oriented person.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s03_s01_p02">According to Fiedler’s theory, different people can be effective in different situations. The LPC score is akin to a personality trait and is not likely to change. Instead, placing the right people in the right situation or changing the situation to suit an individual is important to increase a leader’s effectiveness. The theory predicts that in “favorable” and “unfavorable” situations, a low LPC leader—one who has feelings of dislike for coworkers who are difficult to work with—would be successful. When situational favorableness is medium, a high LPC leader—one who is able to personally like coworkers who are difficult to work with—is more likely to succeed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s03_s01_p03">How does Fiedler determine whether a situation is “favorable,” “medium,” or “unfavorable”? There are three conditions creating situational favorableness: leader-subordinate relations, position power, and task structure. If the leader has a good relationship with most people and has high position power, and the task at hand is structured, the situation is very favorable. When the leader has low-quality relations with employees and has low position power, and the task at hand it relatively unstructured, the situation is very unfavorable.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s03_s02_p01">Another contingency approach to leadership is Kenneth Blanchard and Paul Hersey’s Situational Leadership Theory (SLT) which argues that leaders must use different leadership styles depending on their followers’ development level.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_031">Hersey, P.H., Blanchard, K.H., ' Johnson, D.E. (2007). <em class="emphasis">Management of Organizational Behavior: Leadership human resources.</em> Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.</span> According to this model, employee readiness (defined as a combination of their competence and commitment levels) is the key factor determining the proper leadership style. This approach has been highly popular with 14 million managers across 42 countries undergoing SLT training and 70% of <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 500 companies employing its use.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_032"><a class="link" href="http://www.situational.com/Views/SituationalLeadership/RightHereRightNow.aspx">http://www.situational.com/Views/SituationalLeadership/RightHereRightNow.aspx</a></span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s03_s02_p02">The model summarizes the level of directive and supportive behaviors that leaders may exhibit. The model argues that to be effective, leaders must use the right style of behaviors at the right time in each employee’s development. It is recognized that followers are key to a leader’s success. Employees who are at the earliest stages of developing are seen as being highly committed but with low competence for the tasks. Thus, leaders should be highly directive and less supportive. As the employee becomes more competent, the leader should engage in more coaching behaviors. Supportive behaviors are recommended once the employee is at moderate to high levels of competence. And finally, delegating is the recommended approach for leaders dealing with employees who are both highly committed and highly competent. While the SLT is popular with managers, relatively easy to understand and use, and has endured for decades, research has been mixed in its support of the basic assumptions of the model.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_033">Blank, W., Green, S.G., ' Weitzel, J.R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s03_s03_p01">Robert House’s path-goal theory of leadership is based on the expectancy theory of motivation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_034">House, R. J. (1971). A path goal theory of leader effectiveness. <em class="emphasis">Administrative Science Quarterly</em>, <em class="emphasis">16</em>(3), 321–338.</span> The expectancy theory of motivation suggests that employees are motivated when they believe—or expect—that (a) their effort will lead to high performance, (b) their high performance will be rewarded, and (c) the rewards they will receive are valuable to them. According to the path-goal theory of leadership, the leader’s main job is to make sure that all three of these conditions exist. Thus, leaders will create satisfied and high-performing employees by making sure that employee effort leads to performance, and their performance is rewarded by desired rewards. The leader removes roadblocks along the way and creates an environment that subordinates find motivational.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s03_s03_p02">The theory also makes specific predictions about what type of leader behavior will be effective under which circumstances.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_035">House, R.

J., &amp; Mitchell, T. R. (1974). Path-goal theory of leadership. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Contemporary Business</em>, <em class="emphasis">3</em>, 81–97.</span> The theory identifies four leadership styles. Each of these styles can be effective, depending on the characteristics of employees (such as their ability level, preferences, locus of control, and achievement motivation) and characteristics of the work environment (such as the level of role ambiguity, the degree of stress present in the environment, and the degree to which the tasks are unpleasant).</p>

They lead employees by clarifying role expectations, setting schedules, and making sure that employees know what to do on a given work day. The theory predicts that the directive style will work well when employees are experiencing role ambiguity on the job. If people are unclear about how to go about doing their jobs, giving them specific directions will motivate them. On the other hand, if employees already have role clarity, and if they are performing boring, routine, and highly structured jobs, giving them direction does not help. In fact, it may hurt them by creating an even more restricting atmosphere. Directive leadership is also thought to be less effective when employees have high levels of ability. When managing professional employees with high levels of expertise and job-specific knowledge, telling them what to do may create a low-empowerment environment, which impairs motivation.</p>

G. 1988. <em class="emphasis">The new leadership: managing participation in organizations</em>. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall.</span> The model starts by having leaders answer several key questions and working their way through a decision tree based on their responses. Let’s try it. Imagine that you want to help your employees lower their stress so that you can minimize employee absenteeism. There are a number of approaches you could take to reduce employee stress, such as offering gym memberships, providing employee assistance programs, a nap room, and so forth.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s03_s04_p02">Let’s refer to the model and start with the first question. As you answer each question as high (H) or low (L), follow the corresponding path down the funnel.</p>

            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Decision Significance</em>. The decision has high significance, because the approach chosen needs to be effective at reducing employee stress for the insurance premiums to be lowered. In other words, there is a quality requirement to the decision. Follow the path through H.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Importance of Commitment</em>. Does the leader need employee cooperation to implement the decision? In our example, the answer is high, because employees may simply ignore the resources if they do not like them. Follow the path through H.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Leader expertise</em>. Does the leader have all the information needed to make a high quality decision? In our example, leader expertise is low. You do not have information regarding what your employees need or what kinds of stress reduction resources they would prefer. Follow the path through L.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Likelihood of commitment</em>. If the leader makes the decision alone, what is the likelihood that the employees would accept it? Let’s assume that the answer is low. Based on the leader’s experience with this group, they would likely ignore the decision if the leader makes it alone. Follow the path from L.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Goal alignment</em>. Are the employee goals aligned with organizational goals? In this instance, employee and organizational goals may be aligned because you both want to ensure that employees are healthier. So let’s say the alignment is high, and follow H.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Group expertise</em>. Does the group have expertise in this decision-making area? The group in question has little information about which alternatives are costlier, or more user friendly. We’ll say group expertise is low. Follow the path from L.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Team competence</em>. What is the ability of this particular team to solve the problem? Let’s imagine that this is a new team that just got together and they have little demonstrated expertise to work together effectively. We will answer this as low or L.</li>

Fiedler’s contingency theory argued that task-oriented leaders would be most effective when the situation was the most and the least favorable, whereas people-oriented leaders would be effective when situational favorableness was moderate. Situational Leadership Theory takes the maturity level of followers into account. House’s path-goal theory states that the leader’s job is to ensure that employees view their effort as leading to performance, and to increase the belief that performance would be rewarded. For this purpose, leaders would use directive-, supportive-, participative-, and achievement-oriented leadership styles depending on what employees needed to feel motivated. Vroom and Yetton’s normative model is a guide leaders can use to decide how participative they should be given decision environment characteristics.</p>

Trust is the belief that the leader will show integrity, fairness, and predictability in his or her dealings with others. Research shows that when leaders demonstrate transformational leadership behaviors, followers are more likely to trust the leader.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s01_p07">Even if charisma can be learned, a more fundamental question remains: Is it really needed? Charisma is only one element of transformational leadership, and leaders can be effective without charisma. In fact, charisma has a dark side. For every charismatic hero such as Lee Iaccoca, Steve Jobs, and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.’s Sir Richard Branson, there are charismatic personalities who harmed their organizations or nations, such as Adoph Hitler of Germany and Jeff Skilling of Enron Corporation. Leadership experts warn that when organizations are in a crisis, a board of directors or hiring manager may turn to heroes who they hope will save the organization, and sometimes hire people who have no particular qualifications other than being perceived as charismatic.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_048">Khurana, R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s02_p14">Should you worry if you do not have a high-quality relationship with your manager? One problem in a low-quality exchange is that employees may not have access to the positive work environment available to high LMX members. Secondly, low LMX employees may feel that their situation is unfair. Even when their objective performance does not warrant it, those who have a good relationship with the leader tend to have positive performance appraisals.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_061">Duarte, N. T., Goodson, J. R., &amp; Klich, N. R. (1994). Effects of dyadic quality and duration on performance appraisal. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal</em>, <em class="emphasis">37</em>, 499–521.</span> Moreover, they are more likely to be given the benefit of the doubt. For example, when high LMX employees succeed, the manager is more likely to think that they succeeded because they put forth a lot of effort and had high abilities, whereas for low LMX members who perform objectively well, the manager is less likely to make the same attribution.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_062">Heneman, R. L., Greenberger, D. B., &amp; Anonyuo, C. (1989). Attributions and exchanges: The effects of interpersonal factors on the diagnosis of employee performance. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal</em>, <em class="emphasis">32</em>, 466–476.</span> In other words, the leader may interpret the same situation differently, depending on which employee is involved, and may reward low LMX employees less despite equivalent performance. In short, those with a low-quality relationship with their leader may experience a work environment that may not be supportive or fair.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s02_p15">Despite its negative consequences, we cannot say that all employees want to have a high-quality relationship with their leader. Some employees may genuinely dislike the leader and may not value the rewards in the leader’s possession. If the leader is not well liked in the company and is known as abusive or unethical, being close to such a person may imply guilt by association. For employees who have no interest in advancing their careers in the current company (such as a student employee who is working in retail but has no interest in retail as a career), having a low-quality exchange may afford the opportunity to just do one’s job without having to go above and beyond the job requirements. Finally, not all leaders are equally capable of influencing their employees by having a good relationship with them: It also depends on the power and influence of the leader in the company as a whole and how the leader is treated within the organization. Leaders who are more powerful will have more to share with their employees.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_063">Erdogan, B., &amp; Enders, J. (2007). Support from the top: Supervisors’ perceived organizational support as a moderator of leader-member exchange to satisfaction and performance relationships. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">92</em>, 321–330; Sparrowe, R. T., &amp; Liden, R. C. (2005).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s02_p16">What LMX theory implies for leaders is that one way of influencing employees is through the types of relationships leaders form with their subordinates. These relationships develop naturally through the work-related and personal interactions between the manager and the employee. Because they occur naturally, some leaders may not be aware of the power that lies in them. These relationships have an important influence over employee attitudes and behaviors. In the worst case, they have the potential to create an environment characterized by favoritism and unfairness. Therefore, managers are advised to be aware of how they build these relationships: Put forth effort in cultivating these relationships consciously, be open to forming good relationships with people from all backgrounds regardless of characteristics such as sex, race, age, or disability status, and prevent these relationships from leading to an unfair work environment.</p>

Here are some tips to developing a high-quality exchange.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s02_l01">
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Create interaction opportunities with your manager</em>. One way of doing this would be seeking feedback from your manager with the intention of improving your performance. Be careful though: If the manager believes that you are seeking feedback for a different purpose, it will not help.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">People are more attracted to those who are similar to them</em>. So find out where your similarities lie. What does your manager like that you also like? Do you have similar working styles? Do you have any mutual experiences? Bringing up your commonalities in conversations may help.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Utilize impression management tactics, but be tactful</em>. If there are work-related areas in which you can sincerely compliment your manager, do so. For example, if your manager made a decision that you agree with, you may share your support. Most people, including managers, appreciate positive feedback. However, flattering your manager in non-work-related areas (such as appearance) or using flattery in an insincere way (praising an action you do not agree with) will only backfire and cause you to be labeled as a flatterer.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be a reliable employee</em>. Managers need people they can trust. By performing at a high level, demonstrating predictable and consistent behavior, and by volunteering for challenging assignments, you can prove your worth.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be aware that relationships develop early</em> (as early as the first week of your working together). So be careful how you behave during the interview and your very first days. If you rub your manager the wrong way early on, it will be harder to recover the relationship.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s03_p01">The early 21st century has been marked by a series of highly publicized corporate ethics scandals: Between 2000 and 2003 we witnessed the scandals of Enron, WorldCom, Arthur Andersen LLP, Qwest Communications International Inc., and Global Crossing Ltd. As corporate ethics scandals shake investor confidence in corporations and leaders, the importance of ethical leadership and keeping long-term interests of stakeholders in mind is becoming more widely acknowledged.</p>

According to this approach, the primary mission of the leader is to develop employees and help them reach their goals. Servant leaders put their employees first, understand their personal needs and desires, empower them, and help them develop in their careers. Unlike mainstream management approaches, the overriding objective in servant leadership is not limited to getting employees to contribute to organizational goals. Instead, servant leaders feel an obligation to their employees, customers, and the external community. Employee happiness is seen as an end in itself, and servant leaders sometimes sacrifice their own well-being to help employees succeed. In addition to a clear focus on having a moral compass, servant leaders are also interested in serving the community. In other words, their efforts to help others are not restricted to company insiders, and they are genuinely concerned about the broader community surrounding their organization.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_064">Greenleaf, R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s03_p03">Even though servant leadership has some overlap with other leadership approaches such as transformational leadership, its explicit focus on ethics, community development, and self-sacrifice are distinct characteristics of this leadership style. Research shows that servant leadership has a positive impact on employee commitment, employee citizenship behaviors toward the community (such as participating in community volunteering), and job performance.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_066">Liden, R.

In fact, many of today’s corporate leaders are not known for their humility! However, leaders who have adopted this approach attest to its effectiveness. David Wolfskehl, of Action Fast Print in New Jersey, founded his printing company when he was 24 years old. He marks the day he started asking employees what he can do for them as the beginning of his company’s new culture. In the next 2 years, his company increased its productivity by 30%.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_068">Buchanan, L. (2007, May).

                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Don’t ask what your employees can do for you</em>. Think of what you can do for them. Your job as a leader is to be of service to them. How can you relieve their stress? Protect them from undue pressure? Pitch in to help them? Think about creative ways of helping ease their lives.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">One of your key priorities should be to help employees reach their goals</em>. This involves getting to know them. Learn about who they are and what their values and priorities are.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be humble</em>. You are not supposed to have all the answers and dictate others. One way of achieving this humbleness may be to do volunteer work.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be open with your employees</em>. Ask them questions. Give them information so that they understand what is going on in the company.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Find ways of helping the external community</em>. Giving employees opportunities to be involved in community volunteer projects or even thinking and strategizing about making a positive impact on the greater community would help.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s04_p01">Leaders have to be a lot of things to a lot of people. They operate within different structures, work with different types of people, and they have to be adaptable. At times, it may seem that a leader’s smartest strategy would be to act as a social chameleon, changing his or her style whenever doing so seems advantageous. But this would lose sight of the fact that effective leaders have to stay true to themselves. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">authentic leadership approach</a><span class="glossdef">A leadership approach advising leaders to stay true to their own values.</span></span> embraces this value: Its key advice is “be yourself.” Think about it: We all have different backgrounds, different life experiences, and different role models. These trigger events over the course of our lifetime that shape our values, preferences, and priorities. Instead of trying to fit into societal expectations about what a leader should be, act like, or look like, authentic leaders derive their strength from their own past experiences. Thus, one key characteristic of authentic leaders is that they are self aware. They are introspective, understand where they are coming from, and have a thorough understanding of their own values and priorities. Secondly, they are not afraid to act the way they are. In other words, they have high levels of personal integrity. They say what they think. They behave in a way consistent with their values. As a result, they remain true to themselves. Instead of trying to imitate other great leaders, they find their own style in their personality and life experiences.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_069">Avolio, B. J., &amp; Gardner, W.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s04_p03">Authentic leadership requires understanding oneself. Therefore, in addition to self reflection, feedback from others is needed to gain a true understanding of one’s behavior and its impact on others. Authentic leadership is viewed as a potentially influential style, because employees are more likely to trust such a leader. Moreover, working for an authentic leader is likely to lead to greater levels of satisfaction, performance, and overall well-being on the part of employees.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_071">Walumbwa, F.

            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s04_p04">Contemporary approaches to leadership include transformational leadership, leader-member exchange, servant leadership, and authentic leadership. The transformational leadership approach highlights the importance of leader charisma, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration as methods of influence. Its counterpart is the transactional leadership approach, in which the leader focuses on getting employees to achieve organizational goals. According to the leader-member exchange (LMX) approach, the unique, trust-based relationships leaders develop with employees are the key to leadership effectiveness. Recently, leadership scholars started to emphasize the importance of serving others and adopting a customer-oriented view of leadership; another recent focus is on the importance of being true to oneself as a leader. While each leadership approach focuses on a different element of leadership, effective leaders will need to change their style based on the demands of the situation, as well as utilizing their own values and moral compass.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s05_s01_p01">As some organizations suffer the consequences of ethical crises that put them out of business or damage their reputations, the role of leadership as a driver of ethical behavior is receiving a lot of scholarly attention as well as acknowledgement in the popular press. Ethical decisions are complex and, even to people who are motivated to do the right thing, the moral component of a decision may not be obvious. Therefore, employees often look to role models, influential people, and their managers for guidance in how to behave. Unfortunately, research shows that people tend to follow leaders or other authority figures even when doing so can put others at risk. The famous Milgram experiments support this point. Milgram conducted experiments in which experimental subjects were greeted by someone in a lab coat and asked to administer electric shocks to other people who gave the wrong answer in a learning task. In fact, the shocks were not real and the learners were actors who expressed pain when shocks were administered. Around two-thirds of the experimental subjects went along with the requests and administered the shocks even after they reached what the subjects thought were dangerous levels. In other words, people in positions of authority are influential in driving others to ethical or unethical behaviors.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_072">Milgram, S.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s05_s01_p02">It seems that when evaluating whether someone is an effective leader, subordinates pay attention to the level of ethical behaviors the leader demonstrates. In fact, one study indicated that the perception of being ethical explained 10% of the variance in whether an individual was also perceived as a leader. The level of ethical leadership was related to job satisfaction, dedication to the leader, and a willingness to report job-related problems to the leader.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_073">Brown, M.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s05_s01_p03">Leaders influence the level of ethical behaviors demonstrated in a company by setting the tone of the organizational climate. Leaders who have high levels of moral development create a more ethical organizational climate.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_074">Schminke, M., Ambrose, M. L., &amp; Neubaum, D. O. (2005). The effect of leader moral development on ethical climate and employee attitudes. <em class="emphasis">Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes</em>, <em class="emphasis">97</em>, 135–151.</span> By acting as a role model for ethical behavior, rewarding ethical behaviors, publicly punishing unethical behaviors, and setting high expectations for the level of ethics, leaders play a key role in encouraging ethical behaviors in the workplace.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s05_s01_p04">The more contemporary leadership approaches are more explicit in their recognition that ethics is an important part of effective leadership. Servant leadership emphasizes the importance of a large group of stakeholders, including the external community surrounding a business. On the other hand, authentic leaders have a moral compass, they know what is right and what is wrong, and they have the courage to follow their convictions. Research shows that transformational leaders tend to have higher levels of moral reasoning, even though it is not part of the transformational leadership theory.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_075">Turner, N., Barling, J., Epitropaki, O., Butcher, V., &amp; Milner, C. (2002). Transformational leadership and moral reasoning. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">87</em>, 304–311.</span> It seems that ethical behavior is more likely to happen when (a) leaders are ethical themselves, and (b) they create an organizational climate in which employees understand that ethical behaviors are desired, valued, and expected.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Leadership Around the Globe</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s05_s02_p01">Is leadership universal? This is a critical question given the amount of international activity in the world. Companies that have branches in different countries often send expatriates to manage the operations. These expatriates are people who have demonstrated leadership skills at home, but will these same skills work in the host country? Unfortunately, this question has not yet been fully answered. All the leadership theories that we describe in this chapter are U.S.-based. Moreover, around 98% of all leadership research has been conducted in the United States and other western nations. Thus, these leadership theories may have underlying cultural assumptions. The United States is an individualistic, performance-oriented culture, and the leadership theories suitable for this culture may not necessarily be suitable to other cultures.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s05_s02_p02">People who are perceived as leaders in one society may have different traits compared to people perceived as leaders in a different culture, because each society has a concept of ideal leader prototypes. When we see certain characteristics in a person, we make the attribution that this person is a leader. For example, someone who is confident, caring, and charismatic may be viewed as a leader because we feel that these characteristics are related to being a leader. These leadership prototypes are societally driven and may have a lot to do with a country’s history and its heroes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s05_s02_p03">Recently, a large group of researchers from 62 countries came together to form a project group called Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness or GLOBE.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_076">House, R. J., Hanges, P. J., Javidan, M., Dorfman, P., &amp; Gupta, V. (2004). <em class="emphasis">Culture</em>, <em class="emphasis">leadership, and organizations: The Globe Study of 62 societies</em>. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</span> This group is one of the first to examine leadership differences around the world. Their results are encouraging, because, in addition to identifying differences, they found similarities in leadership styles as well. Specifically, certain leader traits seem to be universal. Around the world, people feel that honesty, decisiveness, being trustworthy, and being fair are related to leadership effectiveness. There is also universal agreement in characteristics viewed as undesirable in leaders: being irritable, egocentric, and a loner.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_077">Den Hartog, D. N., House, R. J., Hanges, P. J., Ruiz-Quintanilla, S. A., &amp; Dorfman, P. W. (1999).

In the eye of the beholder: Cross cultural lessons in leadership from project GLOBE. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Perspectives</em>, <em class="emphasis">20</em>(1), 67–90.</span> Visionary and charismatic leaders were found to be the most influential leaders around the world, followed by team-oriented and participative leaders. In other words, there seems to be a substantial generalizability in some leadership styles.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s05_s02_p04">Even though certain leader behaviors such as charismatic or supportive leadership appear to be universal, what makes someone charismatic or supportive may vary across nations. For example, when leaders fit the leadership prototype, they tend to be viewed as charismatic, but in Turkey, if they are successful but did not fit the prototype, they were still viewed as charismatic.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_078">Ensari, N., &amp; Murphy, S. E. (2003). Cross-cultural variations in leadership perceptions and attribution of charisma to the leader. <em class="emphasis">Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes</em>, <em class="emphasis">92</em>, 52–66.</span> In Western and Latin cultures, people who speak in an emotional and excited manner may be viewed as charismatic. In Asian cultures such as China and Japan, speaking in a monotonous voice may be more impressive because it shows that the leader can control emotions. Similarly, how leaders build relationships or act supportively is culturally determined. In collectivist cultures such as Turkey or Mexico, a manager is expected to show personal interest in employees’ lives. Visiting an employee’s sick mother at the hospital may be a good way of showing concern. Such behavior would be viewed as intrusive or strange in the United States or the Netherlands. Instead, managers may show concern verbally or by lightening the workload of the employee.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_079">Brodbeck, F. C., Frese, M., Akerblom, S., &amp; Audia, G.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s05_s02_p05">There were also many leader characteristics that vary across cultures.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_080">Dorfman, P.

Cross-cultural comparison of leadership prototypes. <em class="emphasis">Leadership Quarterly</em>, <em class="emphasis">5</em>, 121–134.</span> Traits such as being autonomous, conflict avoidant, status conscious, and ambitious were culturally dependent. For example, in France, employees do not expect their leaders to demonstrate empathy. Leaders demonstrating self-sacrifice are also viewed negatively, suggesting that servant leadership would be an improper style there. In Middle Eastern cultures such as Egypt, leaders are expected to be superior to lay people. They are supposed to have all the answers, be confident, and authoritarian. In fact, leading like a benevolent autocrat (someone who cares about people but acts alone) may be an appropriate style.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_081">Javidan, M., Dorfman, P.

In the eye of the beholder: Cross cultural lessons in leadership from project GLOBE. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Perspectives</em>, <em class="emphasis">20</em>(1), 67–90.</span> Even within the same geography, researchers identified substantial cultural differences. For example, in Europe, there were five clusters of cultures. Directness in interpersonal relationships was viewed positively in Nordic cultures such as Finland, but negatively in Near Eastern cultures such as Turkey. Similarly, leaders who are autonomous were viewed positively in Germanic cultures such as Austria, but negatively in Latin European cultures such as Portugal.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_082">Brodbeck, F.

Cultural variation of leadership prototypes across 22 European countries. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">31</em>, 1–29.</span> Finally, in some cultures, good leaders are paternalistic. These leaders act like a parent to employees, give advice, care for them, and get obedience and loyalty in return.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_083">Aycan, Z., Kanungo, R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s05_s02_p06">Given all these differences, effective leaders should develop a sensitivity to cultural differences and adapt their style when they work in different societies or with people from different cultural backgrounds.

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s05_s02_p07">People get their cues for ethical behaviors from leaders. Therefore, leadership characteristics and style will influence the level of ethical behaviors employees demonstrate. Being ethical is related to being perceived as a leader, and ethical leaders create a more satisfied workforce. More contemporary approaches such as servant leadership and authentic leadership explicitly recognize the importance of ethics for leadership effectiveness. Some leadership traits seem to be universal. Visionary, team-oriented, and to a lesser extent participative leadership seem to be the preferred styles around the world. However, traits such as how confident leaders should be and whether they should sacrifice themselves for the good of employees and many others are culturally dependent. Even for universal styles such as charismatic and supportive leadership, how leaders achieve charisma and supportiveness seems to be culturally dependent.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12b_s01_p01">Starbucks Coffee (NASDAQ: SBUX) was born out of a desire for convenience and accessibility to great coffee. In 1971, three friends made that desire a reality and established the first Starbucks coffee house in historic Pike Place Market on Seattle’s waterfront. In 1990, Starbucks drafted its first mission statement, and the number one principle was to “provide a great work environment and treat each other with respect and dignity.” How has the company lived up to that declaration 20 years later?? Starbucks has consistently made <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” list and in addition is included on a list of the best places to work for LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) equality. Working conditions in the service and retail industry are notoriously low paying with long hours, but Starbucks manages to offer benefits for part-time and full-time employees as well as higher-than-average salaries for store managers. Why, one might ask, does Starbucks try so hard to set itself apart?</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12b_s01_p02">Leadership development is a core element of the business process at Starbucks, which ensures that the organizational culture of the company is maintained with every CEO successor. Starbucks is forward looking in this respect and strives to attract future business leaders and managers. The idea of planning for one’s own succession can often make people uneasy, but this idea is openly embraced at Starbucks. The company plans far in advance to replace its top-level successors. The importance of leadership is not only ingrained in the upper management team, but Starbucks also ensures that this is an understood value throughout the organization. In 2004, the Coffee Master program was introduced to teach employees about regional coffee flavors. Graduates of the Coffee Master program earn a prestigious black apron and a special insignia on their business cards. In creating this ethos, Starbucks excels at its ability to attract an educated workforce with a high satisfaction level where individuals often move up to become effective leaders within the company.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12b_s01_p03">With the recession of 2009, Starbucks has been forced to rethink its traditional strategy of accelerated growth by closing over 30,000 stores. CEO Howard Schultz has cut his salary to less than $10,000 a year, down from $1.2 million. Despite these slowdowns, Starbucks continues to call employees “partners” and offers a dynamic place to work. As a result, the company had more than 150,000 people apply for jobs last year, a sure indication that the company’s ability to cultivate talented leaders is as strong as ever.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">12.8</span> Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s06_p01">In this chapter we have reviewed the most influential leadership theories. Trait approaches identify the characteristics required to be perceived as a leader and to be successful in the role. Intelligence, extraversion, conscientiousness, openness to experience, and integrity seem to be leadership traits. Behavioral approaches identify the types of behaviors leaders demonstrate. Both trait and behavioral approaches suffered from a failure to pay attention to the context in which leadership occurs, which led to the development of contingency approaches. Recently, ethics became an explicit focus of leadership theories such as servant leadership and authentic leadership. It seems that being conscious of one’s style and making sure that leaders demonstrate the behaviors that address employee, organizational, and stakeholder needs are important and require flexibility on the part of leaders.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Ethical Dilemma</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s07_p01">You are currently a department manager and Jim is your “trusted assistant.” You have very similar working styles, and you went to the same college and worked in the insurance industry for several years. Before working in this company, you both worked at a different company and you have this shared history with him. You can trust him to come to your aid, support you in your decisions, and be loyal to you. Because of your trust in him, you do not supervise his work closely, and you give him a lot of leeway in how he structures his work. He sometimes chooses to work from home, and he has flexibility in his work hours, which is unusual in the department.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s07_p02">Now you decided to promote him to be the assistant department manager. However, when you shared this opinion with someone else in the department, you realized that this could be a problem. Apparently, Jim is not liked by his colleagues in the department and is known as an “impression manager.” Others view him as a slacker when you are not around, and the fact that he gets the first pick in schedules and gets the choice assignments causes a lot of frustration on the part of others. They feel that you are playing favorites.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s07_p05">You are charged with hiring a manager for a fast-food restaurant. The operations within the store are highly standardized, and employees have very specific job descriptions. The person will be in charge of managing around 30 employees. There is a high degree of turnover among employees, so retention will be an important priority. Most employees who work in the restaurant are young with low levels of work experience, and few of them view the restaurant business as a full-time career. The atmosphere in the restaurant has a fast pace. In this company, managers are often promoted from within, and this position is an exception. Therefore, the incoming manager may not expect a warm welcome from employees who were passed over for a promotion, as well as their colleagues. Finally, the position power of the manager will be somewhat limited because employees are unionized. Therefore, the manager will have limited opportunities for distributing pay raises or bonuses.</p>
