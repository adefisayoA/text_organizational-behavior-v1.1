    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_p08">Job performance is viewed as a function of three factors and is expressed with the equation below.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn05_001">Mitchell, T.

When we refer to someone as being motivated, we mean that the person is trying hard to accomplish a certain task. Motivation is clearly important if someone is to perform well; however, it is not sufficient. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Ability</a><span class="glossdef">Having the skills and knowledge required to perform the job.</span></span>—or having the skills and knowledge required to perform the job—is also important and is sometimes the key determinant of effectiveness. Finally, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">environmental</a><span class="glossdef">External factors that affect performance.</span></span> factors such as having the resources, information, and support one needs to perform well are critical to determine performance. At different times, one of these three factors may be the key to high performance. For example, for an employee sweeping the floor, motivation may be the most important factor that determines performance. In contrast, even the most motivated individual would not be able to successfully design a house without the necessary talent involved in building quality homes. Being motivated is not the same as being a high performer and is not the sole reason why people perform well, but it is nevertheless a key influence over our performance level.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_p10">So what motivates people? Why do some employees try to reach their targets and pursue excellence while others merely show up at work and count the hours? As with many questions involving human beings, the answer is anything but simple. Instead, there are several theories explaining the concept of motivation. We will discuss motivation theories under two categories: need-based theories and process theories.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">5.1</span> A Motivating Place to Work: The Case of Zappos</h2>
    <div class="callout block" id="fwk-122425-ch05a_s01_n01">

        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch05a_s01_p01">It is unique to hear about a CEO who studies happiness and motivation and builds those principles into the company’s core values or about a company with a 5-week training course and an offer of $2,000 to quit anytime during that 5 weeks if you feel the company is not a good fit. Top that off with an on-site life coach who also happens to be a chiropractor, and you are really talking about something you don’t hear about every day. Zappos is known as much for its 365-day return policy and free shipping as it is for its innovative corporate culture. Although acquired in 2009 by Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Zappos managed to move from number 23 in 2009 on <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” list to 15 in 2010.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch05a_s01_p02">Performance is a function of motivation, ability, and the environment in which you work. Zappos seems to be creating an environment that encourages motivation and builds inclusiveness. The company delivers above and beyond basic workplace needs and addresses the self-actualization needs that most individuals desire from their work experience. CEO Tony Hsieh believes that the secret to customer loyalty is to make a corporate culture of caring a priority. This is reflected in the company’s 10 core values and its emphasis on building a team and a family. During the interview process, applicants are asked questions relating to the company’s values, such as gauging their own weirdness, open-mindedness, and sense of family. Although the offer to be paid to quit during the training process has increased from its original number of $400, only 1% of trainees take the offer. Work is structured differently at Zappos as well. For example, there is no limit to the time customer service representatives spend on a phone call, and they are encouraged to make personal connections with the individuals on the other end rather than try to get rid of them.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch05a_s01_p03">Although Zappos has over 1,300 employees, the company has been able to maintain a relatively flat organizational structure and prides itself on its extreme transparency. In an exceptionally detailed and lengthy letter to employees, Hsieh spelled out what the new partnership with Amazon would mean for the company, what would change, and more important, what would remain the same. As a result of this type of company structure, individuals have more freedom, which can lead to greater satisfaction.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch05a_s01_p04">Although Zappos pays its employees well and offers attractive benefits such as employees receiving full health-care coverage and a compressed workweek, the desire to work at Zappos seems to go beyond that. As Hsieh would say, happiness is the driving force behind almost any action an individual takes. Whether your goals are for achievement, affiliation, or simply to find an enjoyable environment in which to work, Zappos strives to address these needs.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s01_p01">The earliest studies of motivation involved an examination of individual needs. Specifically, early researchers thought that employees try hard and demonstrate goal-driven behavior in order to satisfy needs. For example, an employee who is always walking around the office talking to people may have a need for companionship, and his behavior may be a way of satisfying this need. At the time, researchers developed theories to understand what people need. Four theories may be placed under this category: Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, ERG theory, Herzberg’s two-factor theory, and McClelland’s acquired-needs theory.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s01_s01_p01">Abraham Maslow is among the most prominent psychologists of the twentieth century. His hierarchy of needs is an image familiar to most business students and managers. The theory is based on a simple premise: Human beings have needs that are hierarchically ranked.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn05_002">Maslow, A. H. (1943). A theory of human motivation. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Review</em>, <em class="emphasis">50</em>, 370–396; Maslow, A. H. (1954). <em class="emphasis">Motivation and personality</em>. New York: Harper.</span> There are some needs that are basic to all human beings, and in their absence nothing else matters. As we satisfy these basic needs, we start looking to satisfy higher order needs. In other words, once a lower level need is satisfied, it no longer serves as a motivator.</p>

            <img src="section_09/57e8064147db7cb4008fbcda17abbf8a.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s01_s01_p02">The most basic of Maslow’s needs are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">physiological needs</a><span class="glossdef">The need for air, food, and water.</span></span>. Physiological needs refer to the need for food, water, and other biological needs. These needs are basic because when they are lacking, the search for them may overpower all other urges. Imagine being very hungry. At that point, all your behavior may be directed at finding food. Once you eat, though, the search for food ceases and the promise of food no longer serves as a motivator. Once physiological needs are satisfied, people tend to become concerned about <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">safety needs</a><span class="glossdef">The need to be free from danger and pain.</span></span>. Are they free from the threat of danger, pain, or an uncertain future? On the next level up, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social needs</a><span class="glossdef">The needs of bonding with other human beings, being loved, and forming lasting attachments with them.</span></span> refer to the need to bond with other human beings, be loved, and form lasting attachments with others. In fact, attachments, or lack of them, are associated with our health and well-being.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn05_003">Baumeister, R. F., &amp; Leary, M. R. (1995). The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin</em>, <em class="emphasis">117</em>, 497–529.</span> The satisfaction of social needs makes <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">esteem needs</a><span class="glossdef">The desire to be respected by one’s peers, feel important, and be appreciated.</span></span> more salient. Esteem need refers to the desire to be respected by one’s peers, feel important, and be appreciated. Finally, at the highest level of the hierarchy, the need for <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">self-actualization</a><span class="glossdef">The need to become all you are capable of becoming.</span></span> refers to “becoming all you are capable of becoming.” This need manifests itself by the desire to acquire new skills, take on new challenges, and behave in a way that will lead to the attainment of one’s life goals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s01_s01_p03">Maslow was a clinical psychologist, and his theory was not originally designed for work settings. In fact, his theory was based on his observations of individuals in clinical settings; some of the individual components of the theory found little empirical support. One criticism relates to the order in which the needs are ranked. It is possible to imagine that individuals who go hungry and are in fear of their lives might retain strong bonds to others, suggesting a different order of needs. Moreover, researchers failed to support the arguments that once a need is satisfied it no longer serves as a motivator and that only one need is dominant at a given time.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn05_004">Neher, A. (1991). Maslow’s theory of motivation: A critique. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Humanistic Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">31</em>, 89–112; Rauschenberger, J., Schmitt, N., &amp; Hunter, J. E. (1980). A test of the need hierarchy concept by a Markov model of change in need strength. <em class="emphasis">Administrative Science Quarterly</em>, <em class="emphasis">25</em>, 654–670.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s01_s01_p04">Despite the lack of strong research support, Maslow’s theory found obvious applications in business settings. Understanding what people need gives us clues to understanding them. The hierarchy is a systematic way of thinking about the different needs employees may have at any given point and explains different reactions they may have to similar treatment. An employee who is trying to satisfy esteem needs may feel gratified when her supervisor praises an accomplishment. However, another employee who is trying to satisfy social needs may resent being praised by upper management in front of peers if the praise sets the individual apart from the rest of the group.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s01_s01_p05">How can an organization satisfy its employees’ various needs? In the long run, physiological needs may be satisfied by the person’s paycheck, but it is important to remember that pay may satisfy other needs such as safety and esteem as well. Providing generous benefits that include health insurance and company-sponsored retirement plans, as well as offering a measure of job security, will help satisfy safety needs. Social needs may be satisfied by having a friendly environment and providing a workplace conducive to collaboration and communication with others. Company picnics and other social get-togethers may also be helpful if the majority of employees are motivated primarily by social needs (but may cause resentment if they are not and if they have to sacrifice a Sunday afternoon for a company picnic). Providing promotion opportunities at work, recognizing a person’s accomplishments verbally or through more formal reward systems, and conferring job titles that communicate to the employee that one has achieved high status within the organization are among the ways of satisfying esteem needs. Finally, self-actualization needs may be satisfied by the provision of development and growth opportunities on or off the job, as well as by work that is interesting and challenging. By making the effort to satisfy the different needs of each employee, organizations may ensure a highly motivated workforce.</p>

An empirical test of a new theory of human needs. <em class="emphasis">Organizational Behavior and Human Performance</em>, <em class="emphasis">4</em>, 142–175.</span> Instead of the five needs that are hierarchically organized, Alderfer proposed that basic human needs may be grouped under three categories, namely, existence, relatedness, and growth. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Existence</a><span class="glossdef">A need corresponding to Maslow’s physiological and safety needs.</span></span> corresponds to Maslow’s physiological and safety needs, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">relatedness</a><span class="glossdef">A need corresponding to Maslow’s social needs.</span></span> corresponds to social needs, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">growth</a><span class="glossdef">A need referring to Maslow’s esteem and self-actualization.</span></span> refers to Maslow’s esteem and self-actualization.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s01_s02_p02">ERG theory’s main contribution to the literature is its relaxation of Maslow’s assumptions. For example, ERG theory does not rank needs in any particular order and explicitly recognizes that more than one need may operate at a given time. Moreover, the theory has a “frustration-regression” hypothesis suggesting that individuals who are frustrated in their attempts to satisfy one need may regress to another. For example, someone who is frustrated by the growth opportunities in his job and progress toward career goals may regress to relatedness need and start spending more time socializing with coworkers. The implication of this theory is that we need to recognize the multiple needs that may be driving individuals at a given point to understand their behavior and properly motivate them.</p>

You would certainly be miserable in such a work environment. However, if these problems were solved (your office temperature is just right and you are not harassed at all), would you be motivated? Most likely, you would take the situation for granted. In fact, many factors in our work environment are things that we miss when they are absent but take for granted if they are present.</p>

When people are asked why they are satisfied, they may attribute the causes of satisfaction to themselves, whereas when explaining what dissatisfies them, they may blame the situation. The classification of the factors as hygiene or motivator is not that simple either. For example, the theory views pay as a hygiene factor. However, pay may have symbolic value by showing employees that they are being recognized for their contributions as well as communicating that they are advancing within the company. Similarly, the quality of supervision or the types of relationships employees form with their supervisors may determine whether they are assigned interesting work, whether they are recognized for their potential, and whether they take on more responsibilities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s01_s03_p04">Despite its limitations, the theory can be a valuable aid to managers because it points out that improving the environment in which the job is performed goes only so far in motivating employees. Undoubtedly, contextual factors matter because their absence causes dissatisfaction. However, solely focusing on hygiene factors will not be enough, and managers should also enrich jobs by giving employees opportunities for challenging work, greater responsibilities, advancement opportunities, and a job in which their subordinates can feel successful.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s01_s04_p01">Among the need-based approaches to motivation, David McClelland’s acquired-needs theory is the one that has received the greatest amount of support. According to this theory, individuals acquire three types of needs as a result of their life experiences. These needs are the need for achievement, the need for affiliation, and the need for power. All individuals possess a combination of these needs, and the dominant needs are thought to drive employee behavior.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s01_s04_p02">McClelland used a unique method called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)</a><span class="glossdef">A test that assesses a person’s dominant needs.</span></span> to assess the dominant need.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn05_008">Spangler, W. D. (1992). Validity of questionnaire and TAT measures of need for achievement: Two meta-analyses. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin</em>, <em class="emphasis">112</em>, 140–154.</span> This method entails presenting research subjects an ambiguous picture asking them to write a story based on it. Take a look at the following picture. Who is this person? What is she doing? Why is she doing it? The story you tell about the woman in the picture would then be analyzed by trained experts. The idea is that the stories the photo evokes would reflect how the mind works and what motivates the person.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s01_s04_p03">If the story you come up with contains themes of success, meeting deadlines, or coming up with brilliant ideas, you may be high in need for achievement.

Praise for intelligence can undermine children’s motivation and performance. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">75</em>, 33–52.</span> As adults, they are preoccupied with doing things better than they did in the past.

In fact, they are more attracted to organizations that are merit-based and reward performance rather than seniority. They also do particularly well as entrepreneurs, scientists, and engineers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn05_011">Harrell, A. M., &amp; Stahl, M. J. (1981).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s01_s04_p04">Are individuals who are high in need for achievement effective managers? Because of their success in lower level jobs where their individual contributions matter the most, those with high need for achievement are often promoted to higher level positions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn05_012">McClelland, D.

Leadership motive pattern and long-term success in management. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">67</em>, 737–743.</span> However, a high need for achievement has significant disadvantages in management positions. Management involves getting work done by motivating others. When a salesperson is promoted to be a sales manager, the job description changes from actively selling to recruiting, motivating, and training salespeople. Those who are high in need for achievement may view managerial activities such as coaching, communicating, and meeting with subordinates as a waste of time and may neglect these aspects of their jobs. Moreover, those high in need for achievement enjoy doing things themselves and may find it difficult to delegate any meaningful authority to their subordinates. These individuals often micromanage, expecting others to approach tasks a particular way, and may become overbearing bosses by expecting everyone to display high levels of dedication.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn05_013">McClelland, D. C., &amp; Burnham, D. H. (1976). Power is the great motivator. <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em>, <em class="emphasis">25</em>, 159–166.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s01_s04_p05">If the story you created in relation to the picture you are analyzing contains elements of making plans to be with friends or family, you may have a high need for affiliation. Individuals who have a high <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">need for affiliation</a><span class="glossdef">Wanting to be liked and accepted by others.</span></span> want to be liked and accepted by others.

Affiliation motivation and daily experience: Some issues on gender differences. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">60</em>, 154–164.</span> Their emphasis on harmonious interpersonal relationships may be an advantage in jobs and occupations requiring frequent interpersonal interaction, such as a social worker or teacher. In managerial positions, a high need for affiliation may again serve as a disadvantage because these individuals tend to be overly concerned about how they are perceived by others. They may find it difficult to perform some aspects of a manager’s job such as giving employees critical feedback or disciplining poor performers. Thus, the work environment may be characterized by mediocrity and may even lead to high performers leaving the team.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s01_s04_p06">Finally, if your story contains elements of getting work done by influencing other people or desiring to make an impact on the organization, you may have a high need for power. Those with a high <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">need for power</a><span class="glossdef">Wanting to influence others and control their environment.</span></span> want to influence others and control their environment. A need for power may in fact be a destructive element in relationships with colleagues if it takes the form of seeking and using power for one’s own good and prestige. However, when it manifests itself in more altruistic forms such as changing the way things are done so that the work environment is more positive, or negotiating more resources for one’s department, it tends to lead to positive outcomes. In fact, the need for power is viewed as an important trait for effectiveness in managerial and leadership positions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn05_015">McClelland, D. C., &amp; Burnham, D. H. (1976). Power is the great motivator. <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em>, <em class="emphasis">25</em>, 159–166; Spangler, W. D., &amp; House, R. J. (1991).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s01_s04_p07">McClelland’s theory of acquired needs has important implications for the motivation of employees. Managers need to understand the dominant needs of their employees to be able to motivate them. While people who have a high need for achievement may respond to goals, those with a high need for power may attempt to gain influence over those they work with, and individuals high in their need for affiliation may be motivated to gain the approval of their peers and supervisors. Finally, those who have a high drive for success may experience difficulties in managerial positions, and making them aware of common pitfalls may increase their effectiveness.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s01_s04_p08">Need-based theories describe motivated behavior as individuals’ efforts to meet their needs. According to this perspective, the manager’s job is to identify what people need and make the work environment a means of satisfying these needs. Maslow’s hierarchy describes five categories of basic human needs, including physiological, safety, social, esteem, and self-actualization needs. These needs are hierarchically ranked, and as a lower level need is satisfied, it no longer serves as a motivator. ERG theory is a modification of Maslow’s hierarchy, in which the five needs are collapsed into three categories (existence, relatedness, and growth). The theory recognizes that when employees are frustrated while attempting to satisfy higher level needs, they may regress. The two-factor theory differentiates between factors that make people dissatisfied on the job (hygiene factors) and factors that truly motivate employees (motivators). Finally, acquired-needs theory argues that individuals possess stable and dominant motives to achieve, acquire power, or affiliate with others. The type of need that is dominant will drive behavior. Each of these theories explains characteristics of a work environment that motivates employees. These theories paved the way to process-based theories that explain the mental calculations employees make to decide how to behave.</p>

Instead, process-based theories view motivation as a rational process. Individuals analyze their environment, develop thoughts and feelings, and react in certain ways. Process theories attempt to explain the thought processes of individuals who demonstrate motivated behavior. Under this category, we will review equity theory, expectancy theory, and reinforcement theory.</p>

You stay late when necessary and are flexible if requested to change hours.

Moreover, our sense of fairness is a result of the social comparisons we make. Specifically, we compare our inputs and outcomes with other people’s inputs and outcomes.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s02_s01_s01_p01">Inputs are the contributions people feel they are making to the environment. In the previous example, the person’s hard work; loyalty to the organization; amount of time with the organization; and level of education, training, and skills may have been relevant inputs. Outcomes are the perceived rewards someone can receive from the situation. For the hourly wage employee in our example, the $10 an hour pay rate was a core outcome. There may also be other, more peripheral outcomes, such as acknowledgment or preferential treatment from a manager. In the prior example, however, the person may reason as follows: I have been working here for 6 months. I am loyal, and I perform well (inputs). I am paid $10 an hour for this (outcomes). The new person does not have any experience here (referent’s inputs) but will be paid $14 an hour. This situation is unfair.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s02_s01_s01_p02">We should emphasize that equity perceptions develop as a result of a subjective process.

Oftentimes, the situation may be dealt with perceptually by <em class="emphasis">altering our perceptions of our own or the referent’s inputs and outcomes</em>. For example, we may justify the situation by downplaying our own inputs (I don’t really work very hard on this job), valuing our outcomes more highly (I am gaining valuable work experience, so the situation is not that bad), distorting the other person’s inputs (the new hire really is more competent than I am and deserves to be paid more), or distorting the other person’s outcomes (she gets $14 an hour but will have to work with a lousy manager, so the situation is not unfair). Another option would be to <em class="emphasis">have the referent increase inputs</em>. If the other person brings more to the situation, getting more out of the situation would be fair. If that person can be made to work harder or work on more complicated tasks, equity would be achieved. The person experiencing a perceived inequity may also <em class="emphasis">reduce inputs or attempt to increase outcomes</em>. If the lower paid person puts forth less effort, the perceived inequity would be reduced.

Originally, equity theory proposed that over-rewarded individuals would experience guilt and would increase their effort to restore perceptions of equity. However, research does not provide support for this argument. Instead, it seems that individuals experience less distress as a result of being over-rewarded.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn05_020">Austin, W., &amp; Walster, E. (1974).

Second, low levels of expectancy may be because employees may feel that something other than effort predicts performance, such as political behaviors on the part of employees. If employees believe that the work environment is not conducive to performing well (resources are lacking or roles are unclear), expectancy will also suffer. Therefore, clearing the path to performance and creating an environment in which employees do not feel restricted will be helpful. Finally, some employees may perceive little connection between their effort and performance level because they have an external locus of control, low self-esteem, or other personality traits that condition them to believe that their effort will not make a difference. In such cases, providing positive feedback and encouragement may help motivate employees.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s02_s02_s02_p01">Showing employees that their performance is rewarded is going to increase instrumentality perceptions. Therefore, the first step in influencing instrumentality is to connect pay and other rewards to performance using bonuses, award systems, and merit pay. However, this is not always sufficient, because people may not be aware of some of the rewards awaiting high performers. Publicizing any contests or award programs is needed to bring rewards to the awareness of employees. It is also important to highlight that performance, not something else, is being rewarded. For example, if a company has an employee of the month award that is rotated among employees, employees are unlikely to believe that performance is being rewarded. This type of meritless reward system may actually hamper the motivation of the highest performing employees by eroding instrumentality.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Reinforcement Theory</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s02_s03_p01">Reinforcement theory is based on the work of Ivan Pavlov on behavioral conditioning and the later work of B. F. Skinner on operant conditioning.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn05_037">Skinner, B. F. (1953). <em class="emphasis">Science and human behavior</em>. New York: Free Press.</span> According to reinforcement theory, behavior is a function of its outcomes. Imagine that even though no one asked you to, you stayed late and drafted a report. When the manager found out, she was ecstatic and took you out to lunch and thanked you genuinely. The consequences following your good deed were favorable, and therefore you are more likely to demonstrate similar behaviors in the future. In other words, your taking initiative was reinforced. Instead, if your manager had said nothing about it and everyone ignored the sacrifice you made, you are less likely to demonstrate similar behaviors in the future.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s02_s03_p02">Reinforcement theory is based on a simple idea that may be viewed as common sense. Beginning at infancy we learn through reinforcement. If you have observed a small child discovering the environment, you will see reinforcement theory in action. When the child discovers manipulating a faucet leads to water coming out and finds this outcome pleasant, he is more likely to repeat the behavior. If he burns his hand while playing with hot water, the child is likely to stay away from the faucet in the future.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s02_s03_p03">Despite the simplicity of reinforcement, how many times have you seen positive behavior ignored, or worse, negative behavior rewarded? In many organizations, this is a familiar scenario. People go above and beyond the call of duty, yet their actions are ignored or criticized. People with disruptive habits may receive no punishments because the manager is afraid of the reaction the person will give when confronted. Problem employees may even receive rewards such as promotions so they will be transferred to a different location and become someone else’s problem. Moreover, it is common for people to be rewarded for the wrong kind of behavior. Steven Kerr has labeled this phenomenon “the folly of rewarding A while hoping for B.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn05_038">Kerr, S. (1995). On the folly of rewarding A while hoping for B. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Executive</em>, <em class="emphasis">9</em>, 7–14.</span> For example, a company may make public statements about the importance of quality. Yet, if they choose to reward shipments on time regardless of the amount of defects contained in the shipments, employees are more likely to ignore quality and focus on hurrying the delivery process. Because people learn to repeat their behaviors based on the consequences following their prior activities, managers will need to systematically examine the consequences of employee behavior and make interventions when needed.</p>

For example, the person may start avoiding the manager to avoid being nagged.</p>

The model consists of five stages. The process starts with identifying the behavior that will be modified. Let’s assume that we are interested in reducing absenteeism among employees. In step 2, we need to measure the baseline level of absenteeism. How many times a month is a particular employee absent? In step 3, the behavior’s antecedents and consequences are determined. Why is this employee absent? More importantly, what is happening when the employee is absent? If the behavior is being unintentionally rewarded (e.g., the person is still getting paid or is able to avoid unpleasant assignments because someone else is doing them), we may expect these positive consequences to reinforce the absenteeism. Instead, to reduce the frequency of absenteeism, it will be necessary to think of financial or social incentives to follow positive behavior and negative consequences to follow negative behavior. In step 4, an intervention is implemented. Removing the positive consequences of negative behavior may be an effective way of dealing with the situation, or, in persistent situations, punishments may be used. Finally, in step 5 the behavior is measured periodically and maintained.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s02_s03_s02_p05">Process-based theories use the mental processes of employees as the key to understanding employee motivation. According to equity theory, employees are demotivated when they view reward distribution as unfair. Perceptions of fairness are shaped by the comparisons they make between their inputs and outcomes with respect to a referent’s inputs and outcomes. Following equity theory, research identified two other types of fairness (procedural and interactional) that also affect worker reactions and motivation. According to expectancy theory, employees are motivated when they believe that their effort will lead to high performance (expectancy), when they believe that their performance will lead to outcomes (instrumentality), and when they find the outcomes following performance to be desirable (valence). Reinforcement theory argues that behavior is a function of its consequences. By properly tying rewards to positive behaviors, eliminating rewards following negative behaviors, and punishing negative behaviors, leaders can increase the frequency of desired behaviors. These three theories are particularly useful in designing reward systems within a company.</p>

Motivation theories have been applied to explain this interesting and important question. One theory that has been particularly successful in explaining ethical behavior is reinforcement theory. Just like any other behavior such as performance or cooperation, ethical behavior is one that is learned as a result of the consequences following one’s actions. For example, in an experiment simulating the job of a sales manager, participants made a series of decisions using a computer. Partway through the simulation, subjects were informed that salespeople reporting to them were giving kickbacks to customers. Subjects in this experiment were more likely to cut the kickbacks if there was a threat of punishment to the manager. On the other hand, subjects playing the sales manager were more likely to continue giving away the kickbacks if they made a profit after providing the kickbacks.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn05_045">Hegarty, W. H., &amp; Sims, H. P. (1978). Some determinants of unethical decision behavior: An experiment. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">63</em>, 451–457.</span> In a separate study highlighting the importance of rewards and punishments, researchers found that the severity of expected punishment was the primary predictor of whether subjects reported inclination to behave unethically. In addition to the severity of the punishment, the perceived likelihood of punishment was also a major influence of ethical behavior.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn05_046">Rettig, S., &amp; Rawson, H. E. (1963). The risk hypothesis in predictive judgments of unethical behavior. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">66</em>, 243–248.</span> These findings highlight the importance of rewards and punishments for motivating unethical behaviors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s03_s01_p02">There are many organizational situations in which individuals may do unethical things but then experience positive consequences such as being awarded promotions for meeting their sales quotas. For example, in many hotels, staff members routinely receive kickbacks from restaurants or bars if they refer customers to those locations.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn05_047">Elliott, C. (2007). Is your bellhop on the take? <em class="emphasis">National Geographic Traveler</em>, <em class="emphasis">24</em>(3), 18–20.</span> Similarly, sales staff rewarded with spiffs (product-specific sales incentives) may give customers advice that goes against their own personal beliefs and in this sense act unethically.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn05_048">Radin, T.

Thus, in order to minimize the occurrence of unethical behavior (and in some instances legal problems), it seems important to examine the rewards and punishments that follow unethical behavior and remove rewards following unethical behavior while increasing the severity and likelihood of punishment.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s03_s02_p04">Motivation theories are particularly useful for understanding why employees behave unethically. Based on reinforcement theory, people will demonstrate higher unethical behaviors if their unethical behaviors are followed by rewards or go unpunished. Similarly, according to expectancy theory, if people believe that their unethical actions will be rewarded with desirable outcomes, they are more likely to demonstrate unethical behaviors. In terms of culture, some of the motivation theories are likely to be culture-bound, whereas others may more readily apply to other cultures. Existing research shows that what is viewed as fair or unfair tends to be culturally defined.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">5.5</span> Motivation in Action: The Case of Trader Joe’s</h2>
    <div class="callout block" id="fwk-122425-ch05b_s01_n01">

        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch05b_s01_p01">People in Hawaiian T-shirts. Delicious fresh fruits and vegetables. A place where parking is tight and aisles are tiny. A place where you will be unable to find half the things on your list but will go home satisfied. We are, of course, talking about Trader Joe’s (a privately held company), a unique grocery store headquartered in California and located in 22 states. By selling store-brand and gourmet foods at affordable prices, this chain created a special niche for itself. Yet the helpful employees who stock the shelves and answer questions are definitely key to what makes this store unique and helps it achieve twice the sales of traditional supermarkets.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch05b_s01_p02">Shopping here is fun, and chatting with employees is a routine part of this experience. Employees are upbeat and friendly to each other and to customers. If you look lost, there is the definite offer of help. But somehow the friendliness does not seem scripted. Instead, if they see you shopping for big trays of cheese, they might casually inquire if you are having a party and then point to other selections. If they see you chasing your toddler, they are quick to tie a balloon to his wrist. When you ask them if they have any cumin, they get down on their knees to check the back of the aisle, with the attitude of helping a guest that is visiting their home. How does a company make sure its employees look like they enjoy being there to help others?</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch05b_s01_p03">One of the keys to this puzzle is pay. Trader Joe’s sells cheap organic food, but they are not “cheap” when it comes to paying their employees. Employees, including part-timers, are among the best paid in the retail industry. Full-time employees earn an average of $40,150 in their first year and also earn average annual bonuses of $950 with $6,300 in retirement contributions. Store managers’ average compensation is $132,000. With these generous benefits and above-market wages and salaries, the company has no difficulty attracting qualified candidates.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch05b_s01_p04">But money only partially explains what energizes Trader Joe’s employees. They work with people who are friendly and upbeat. The environment is collaborative, so that people fill in for each other and managers pick up the slack when the need arises, including tasks like sweeping the floors. Plus, the company promotes solely from within, making Trader Joe’s one of few places in the retail industry where employees can satisfy their career aspirations. Employees are evaluated every 3 months and receive feedback about their performance.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch05b_s01_p05">Employees are also given autonomy on the job. They can open a product to have the customers try it and can be honest about their feelings toward different products. They receive on- and off-the-job training and are intimately familiar with the products, which enables them to come up with ideas that are taken seriously by upper management. In short, employees love what they do, work with nice people who treat each other well, and are respected by the company. When employees are treated well, it is no wonder they treat their customers well daily.</p>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-122425-ch05b_s01_l01">
            <li>How much of Trader Joe’s success can be attributed to the fact that most larger chain grocery stores do not sell the type of food available at Trader Joe’s?</li>
            <li>Is pay enough of an incentive to continue at a job you do not enjoy?</li>
            <li>Trader Joe’s promotes entirely from within the organization. This means that if you are a good, dedicated worker, you can rise up within the company. Do you feel employees would be as dedicated to the company if this were not the case? Would high pay be enough to keep employees? What if the company only promoted from within but pay were not as good?</li>

<span class="title-prefix">5.6</span> Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s04_p01">In this chapter we have reviewed the basic motivation theories that have been developed to explain motivated behavior. Several theories view motivated behavior as attempts to satisfy needs. Based on this approach, managers would benefit from understanding what people need so that the actions of employees can be understood and managed. Other theories explain motivated behavior using the cognitive processes of employees. Employees respond to unfairness in their environment, they learn from the consequences of their actions and repeat the behaviors that lead to positive results, and they are motivated to exert effort if they see their actions will lead to outcomes that would get them desired rewards. None of these theories are complete on their own, but each theory provides us with a framework we can use to analyze, interpret, and manage employee behaviors in the workplace.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Ethical Dilemma</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s05_p01">Companies are interested in motivating employees: Work hard, be productive, behave ethically—and stay healthy. Health care costs are rising, and employers are finding that unhealthy habits such as smoking or being overweight are costing companies big bucks.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s05_p02">Your company is concerned about the rising health care costs and decides to motivate employees to adopt healthy habits. Therefore, employees are given a year to quit smoking. If they do not quit by then, they are going to lose their jobs. New employees will be given nicotine tests, and the company will avoid hiring new smokers in the future. The company also wants to encourage employees to stay healthy. For this purpose, employees will get cash incentives for weight loss. If they do not meet the weight, cholesterol, and blood pressure standards to be issued by the company, they will be charged extra fees for health insurance.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s05_p03">Is this plan ethical? Why or why not? Can you think of alternative ways to motivate employees to adopt healthy habits?</p>

        <h3 class="title">Individual Exercise</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s05_p04">Your company provides diversity training programs to ensure that employees realize the importance of working with a diverse workforce, are aware of the equal employment opportunity legislation, and are capable of addressing the challenges of working in a multicultural workforce. Participation in these programs is mandatory, and employees are required to take the training as many times as needed until they pass. The training program lasts one day and is usually conducted in a nice hotel outside the workplace. Employees are paid for the time they spend in the training program. You realize that employees are not really motivated to perform well in this program. During the training, they put in the minimum level of effort, and most participants fail the exam given at the conclusion of the training program and then have to retake the training.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s05_p05">Using expectancy and reinforcement theories, explain why they may not be motivated to perform well in the training program. Then suggest improvements in the program so that employees are motivated to understand the material, pass the exam, and apply the material in the workplace.</p>

He has accumulated a large credit card debt. He has worked for the company for 3 years and worked for the project in the last 6 months.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch05_s05_p11">Carrie: <em class="emphasis">Web developer</em>. She was in charge of writing the code.
