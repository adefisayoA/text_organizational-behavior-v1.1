Moreover, people are more likely to accept job offers when the company possesses the values people care about.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_006">Judge, T. A., &amp; Bretz, R. D. (1992).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s01_p02">What are the values people care about? There are many typologies of values. One of the most established surveys to assess individual values is the Rokeach Value Survey.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_008">Rokeach, M. (1973). <em class="emphasis">The nature of human values.</em> New York: The Free Press.</span> This survey lists 18 terminal and 18 instrumental values in alphabetical order. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Terminal values</a><span class="glossdef">End states people desire in life, such as leading a prosperous life and a world at peace.</span></span> refer to end states people desire in life, such as leading a prosperous life and a world at peace. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Instrumental values</a><span class="glossdef">Views on acceptable modes of conduct, such as being honest and ethical, and being ambitious.</span></span> deal with views on acceptable modes of conduct, such as being honest and ethical, and being ambitious.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s01_p03">According to Rokeach, values are arranged in hierarchical fashion. In other words, an accurate way of assessing someone’s values is to ask them to rank the 36 values in order of importance. By comparing these values, people develop a sense of which value can be sacrificed to achieve the other, and the individual priority of each value emerges.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s01_p04">Where do values come from? Research indicates that they are shaped early in life and show stability over the course of a lifetime. Early family experiences are important influences over the dominant values. People who were raised in families with low socioeconomic status and those who experienced restrictive parenting often display conformity values when they are adults, while those who were raised by parents who were cold toward their children would likely value and desire security.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_009">Kasser, T., Koestner, R., &amp; Lekes, N. (2002). Early family experiences and adult values: A 26-year prospective longitudinal study. <em class="emphasis">Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, <em class="emphasis">28</em>, 826–835.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s01_p05">Values of a generation also change and evolve in response to the historical context that the generation grows up in. Research comparing the values of different generations resulted in interesting findings. For example, Generation Xers (those born between the mid-1960s and 1980s) are more individualistic and are interested in working toward organizational goals so long as they coincide with their personal goals. This group, compared to the baby boomers (born between the 1940s and 1960s), is also less likely to see work as central to their life and more likely to desire a quick promotion.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_010">Smola, K. W., &amp; Sutton, C. D. (2002). Generational differences: Revisiting generational work values for the new millennium. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Organizational Behavior</em>, <em class="emphasis">23</em>, 363–382.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s01_p06">The values a person holds will affect his or her employment. For example, someone who has an orientation toward strong stimulation may pursue extreme sports and select an occupation that involves fast action and high risk, such as fire fighter, police officer, or emergency medical doctor. Someone who has a drive for achievement may more readily act as an entrepreneur. Moreover, whether individuals will be satisfied at a given job may depend on whether the job provides a way to satisfy their dominant values. Therefore, understanding employees at work requires understanding the value orientations of employees.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Personality</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Personality</a><span class="glossdef">The relatively stable feelings, thoughts, and behavioral patterns a person has.</span></span> encompasses the relatively stable feelings, thoughts, and behavioral patterns a person has. Our personality differentiates us from other people, and understanding someone’s personality gives us clues about how that person is likely to act and feel in a variety of situations. In order to effectively manage organizational behavior, an understanding of different employees’ personalities is helpful. Having this knowledge is also useful for placing people in jobs and organizations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s02_p02">If personality is stable, does this mean that it does not change? You probably remember how you have changed and evolved as a result of your own life experiences, attention you received in early childhood, the style of parenting you were exposed to, successes and failures you had in high school, and other life events. In fact, our personality changes over long periods of time. For example, we tend to become more socially dominant, more conscientious (organized and dependable), and more emotionally stable between the ages of 20 and 40, whereas openness to new experiences may begin to decline during this same time.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_011">Roberts, B. W., Walton, K. E., &amp; Viechtbauer, W. (2006). Patterns of mean-level change in personality traits across the life course: A meta-analysis of longitudinal studies. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin</em>, <em class="emphasis">132</em>, 1–25.</span> In other words, even though we treat personality as relatively stable, changes occur. Moreover, even in childhood, our personality shapes who we are and has lasting consequences for us. For example, studies show that part of our career success and job satisfaction later in life can be explained by our childhood personality.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_012">Judge, T. A., &amp; Higgins, C. A. (1999).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s02_p03">Is our behavior in organizations dependent on our personality? To some extent, yes, and to some extent, no. While we will discuss the effects of personality for employee behavior, you must remember that the relationships we describe are modest correlations. For example, having a sociable and outgoing personality may encourage people to seek friends and prefer social situations. This does not mean that their personality will immediately affect their work behavior. At work, we have a job to do and a role to perform. Therefore, our behavior may be more strongly affected by what is expected of us, as opposed to how we want to behave. When people have a lot of freedom at work, their personality will become a stronger influence over their behavior.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_013">Barrick, M. R., &amp; Mount, M. K.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s02_s01_p01">How many personality traits are there? How do we even know? In every language, there are many words describing a person’s personality. In fact, in the English language, more than 15,000 words describing personality have been identified. When researchers analyzed the terms describing personality characteristics, they realized that there were many words that were pointing to each dimension of personality. When these words were grouped, five dimensions seemed to emerge that explain a lot of the variation in our personalities.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_014">Goldberg, L. R. (1990). An alternative “description of personality”: The big-five factor structure. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">59</em>, 1216–1229.</span> Keep in mind that these five are not necessarily the only traits out there. There are other, specific traits that represent dimensions not captured by the Big Five. Still, understanding the main five traits gives us a good start for describing personality.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p01">Aside from the Big Five personality traits, perhaps the most well-known and most often used personality assessment is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Unlike the Big Five, which assesses traits, MBTI measures types. Assessments of the Big Five do not classify people as neurotic or extravert: It is all a matter of degrees. MBTI on the other hand, classifies people as one of 16 types.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_039">Carlyn, M. (1977). An assessment of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality Assessment</em>, <em class="emphasis">41</em>, 461–473; Myers, I. B. (1962). <em class="emphasis">The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</em>. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.</span> In MBTI, people are grouped using four dimensions. Based on how a person is classified on these four dimensions, it is possible to talk about 16 unique personality types, such as ESTJ and ISTP.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p02">MBTI was developed in 1943 by a mother–daughter team, Isabel Myers and Katherine Cook Briggs. Its objective at the time was to aid World War II veterans in identifying the occupation that would suit their personalities. Since that time, MBTI has become immensely popular, and according to one estimate, around 2.5 million people take the test annually. The survey is criticized because it relies on types as opposed to traits, but organizations who use the survey find it very useful for training and team-building purposes. More than 80 of the <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 100 companies used Myers-Briggs tests in some form. One distinguishing characteristic of this test is that it is explicitly designed for learning, not for employee selection purposes. In fact, the Myers &amp; Briggs Foundation has strict guidelines against the use of the test for employee selection. Instead, the test is used to provide mutual understanding within the team and to gain a better understanding of the working styles of team members.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_040">Leonard, D., &amp; Straus, S.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s02_s03_p01">You may have noticed that behavior is also a function of moods. When people are in a good mood, they may be more cooperative, smile more, and act friendly. When these same people are in a bad mood, they may have a tendency to be picky, irritable, and less tolerant of different opinions. Yet, some people seem to be in a good mood most of the time, and others seem to be in a bad mood most of the time regardless of what is actually going on in their lives.

<em class="emphasis">Take a self-inventory</em>. What are the areas in which you lack confidence? Then consciously tackle these areas. Take part in training programs; seek opportunities to practice these skills. Confront your fears head-on.</li>

<em class="emphasis">Set manageable goals</em>. Success in challenging goals will breed self-confidence, but do not make your goals impossible to reach. If a task seems daunting, break it apart and set mini goals.</li>

<em class="emphasis">Don’t judge yourself by your failures</em>. Everyone fails, and the most successful people have more failures in life. Instead of assessing your self-worth by your failures, learn from mistakes and move on.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Until you can feel confident, be sure to act confident</em>. Acting confident will influence how others treat you, which will boost your confidence level. Pay attention to how you talk and behave, and act like someone who has high confidence.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Know when to ignore negative advice</em>. If you receive negative feedback from someone who is usually negative, try to ignore it. Surrounding yourself with naysayers is not good for your self-esteem. This does not mean that you should ignore all negative feedback, but be sure to look at a person’s overall attitude before making serious judgments based on that feedback.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Personality Testing in Employee Selection</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s03_p01">Personality is a potentially important predictor of work behavior. Matching people to jobs matters, because when people do not fit with their jobs or the company, they are more likely to leave, costing companies as much as a person’s annual salary to replace them. In job interviews, companies try to assess a candidate’s personality and the potential for a good match, but interviews are only as good as the people conducting them. In fact, interviewers are not particularly good at detecting the best trait that predicts performance: conscientiousness.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_068">Barrick, M. R., Patton, G. K., &amp; Haugland, S. N. (2000). Accuracy of interviewer judgments of job applicant personality traits. <em class="emphasis">Personnel Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">53</em>, 925–951.</span> One method some companies use to improve this match and detect the people who are potentially good job candidates is personality testing. Companies such as Kronos and Hogan Assessment Systems conduct preemployment personality tests. Companies using them believe that these tests improve the effectiveness of their selection and reduce turnover. For example, Overnight Transportation in Atlanta found that using such tests reduced their on-the-job delinquency by 50%–100%.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_069">Emmett, A. (2004). Snake oil or science? That’s the raging debate on personality testing. <em class="emphasis">Workforce Management</em>, <em class="emphasis">83</em>, 90–92; Gale, S. F. (2002). Three companies cut turnover with tests. <em class="emphasis">Workforce</em>, <em class="emphasis">81</em>(4), 66–69.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s03_p02">Yet, are these methods good ways of selecting employees? Experts have not yet reached an agreement on this subject and the topic is highly controversial. Some experts believe, based on data, that personality tests predict performance and other important criteria such as job satisfaction. However, we must understand that how a personality test is used influences its validity. Imagine filling out a personality test in class. You may be more likely to fill it out as honestly as you can. Then, if your instructor correlates your personality scores with your class performance, we could say that the correlation is meaningful. In employee selection, one complicating factor is that people filling out the survey do not have a strong incentive to be honest. In fact, they have a greater incentive to guess what the job requires and answer the questions to match what they think the company is looking for. As a result, the rankings of the candidates who take the test may be affected by their ability to fake. Some experts believe that this is a serious problem.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_070">Morgeson, F. P., Campion, M. A., Dipboye, R. L., Hollenbeck, J. R., Murphy, K., &amp; Schmitt, N.

Coming to terms with limitations in the use of personality tests for personnel selection. <em class="emphasis">Personnel Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">60</em>, 1029–1049.</span> Others point out that even with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">faking</a><span class="glossdef">The practice of answering questions in a way one thinks the company is looking for.</span></span>, the tests remain valid—the scores are still related to job performance.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_071">Barrick, M.

This issue raises potential questions regarding whether personality tests are the most effective way of measuring candidate personality.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s03_p03">Scores are not only distorted because of some candidates faking better than others. Do we even know our own personality? Are we the best person to ask this question? How supervisors, coworkers, and customers see our personality matters more than how we see ourselves. Therefore, using self-report measures of performance may not be the best way of measuring someone’s personality.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_072">Mount, M. K., Barrick, M. R., &amp; Strauss, J. P. (1994). Validity of observer ratings of the Big Five personality factors. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">79</em>, 272–280.</span> We all have blind areas. We may also give “aspirational” answers. If you are asked if you are honest, you may think, “Yes, I always have the intention to be honest.” This response says nothing about your actual level of honesty.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s03_p04">There is another problem with using these tests: How good a predictor of performance is personality anyway? Based on research, not a particularly strong one. According to one estimate, personality only explains about 10%–15% of variation in job performance. Our performance at work depends on so many factors, and personality does not seem to be the key factor for performance. In fact, cognitive ability (your overall mental intelligence) is a much more powerful influence on job performance, and instead of personality tests, cognitive ability tests may do a better job of predicting who will be good performers. Personality is a better predictor of job satisfaction and other attitudes, but screening people out on the assumption that they may be unhappy at work is a challenging argument to make in the context of employee selection.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s03_p05">In any case, if you decide to use these tests for selection, you need to be aware of their limitations. Relying only on personality tests for selection of an employee is a bad idea, but if they are used together with other tests such as tests of cognitive abilities, better decisions may be made. The company should ensure that the test fits the job and actually predicts performance. This process is called validating the test. Before giving the test to applicants, the company could give it to existing employees to find out the traits that are most important for success in the particular company and job. Then, in the selection context, the company can pay particular attention to those traits. The company should also make sure that the test does not discriminate against people on the basis of sex, race, age, disabilities, and other legally protected characteristics. Rent-A-Center experienced legal difficulties when the test they used was found to be a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The test they used for selection, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, was developed to diagnose severe mental illnesses and included items such as “I see things or people around me others do not see.” In effect, the test served the purpose of a clinical evaluation and was discriminating against people with mental illnesses, which is a protected category under ADA.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_073">Heller, M.

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s03_p06">Values and personality traits are two dimensions on which people differ. Values are stable life goals. When seeking jobs, employees are more likely to accept a job that provides opportunities for value attainment, and they are more likely to remain in situations that satisfy their values. Personality comprises the stable feelings, thoughts, and behavioral patterns people have. The Big Five personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) are important traits that seem to be stable and can be generalized to other cultures. Other important traits for work behavior include self-efficacy, self-esteem, social monitoring, proactive personality, positive and negative affectivity, and locus of control. It is important to remember that a person’s behavior depends on the match between the person and the situation. While personality is a strong influence on job attitudes, its relation to job performance is weaker. Some companies use personality testing to screen out candidates. This method has certain limitations, and companies using personality tests are advised to validate their tests and use them as a supplement to other techniques that have greater validity.</p>
