        <h2 class="title editable block">Organizational Politics</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch13_s03_s01_p01">Organizational politics are informal, unofficial, and sometimes behind-the-scenes efforts to sell ideas, influence an organization, increase power, or achieve other targeted objectives.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn13_033">Brandon, R., &amp; Seldman, M. (2004). <em class="emphasis">Survival of the savvy: High-integrity political tactics for career and company success</em>. New York: Free Press; Hochwarter, W. A., Witt, L. A., &amp; Kacmar, K. M. (2000). Perceptions of organizational politics as a moderator of the relationship between conscientiousness and job performance. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">85</em>, 472–478.</span> Politics has been around for millennia. Aristotle wrote that politics stems from a diversity of interests, and those competing interests must be resolved in some way. “Rational” decision making alone may not work when interests are fundamentally incongruent, so political behaviors and influence tactics arise.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch13_s03_s01_p02">Today, work in organizations requires skill in handling conflicting agendas and shifting power bases. Effective politics isn’t about winning at all costs but about maintaining relationships while achieving results. Although often portrayed negatively, organizational politics are not inherently bad. Instead, it’s important to be aware of the potentially destructive aspects of organizational politics in order to minimize their negative effect. Of course, individuals within organizations can waste time overly engaging in political behavior. Research reported in <em class="emphasis">HR Magazine</em> found that managers waste 20% of their time managing politics. However, as John Kotter wrote in <em class="emphasis">Power and Influence</em>, “Without political awareness and skill, we face the inevitable prospect of becoming immersed in bureaucratic infighting, parochial politics and destructive power struggles, which greatly retard organizational initiative, innovation, morale, and performance.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn13_034">Kotter, J. (1985). <em class="emphasis">Power and influence</em>. New York: Free Press.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch13_s03_s01_p03">In our discussion about power, we saw that power issues often arise around scarce resources. Organizations typically have limited resources that must be allocated in some way. Individuals and groups within the organization may disagree about how those resources should be allocated, so they may naturally seek to gain those resources for themselves or for their interest groups, which gives rise to organizational politics. Simply put, with organizational politics, individuals ally themselves with like-minded others in an attempt to win the scarce resources. They’ll engage in behavior typically seen in government organizations, such as bargaining, negotiating, alliance building, and resolving conflicting interests.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch13_s03_s01_p04">Politics are a part of organizational life, because organizations are made up of different interests that need to be aligned. In fact, 93% of managers surveyed reported that workplace politics exist in their organization, and 70% felt that in order to be successful, a person has to engage in politics.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn13_035">Gandz, J., &amp; Murray, V. V. (1980). The experience of workplace politics. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal</em>, <em class="emphasis">23</em>, 237–251.</span> In the negative light, saying that someone is “political” generally stirs up images of back-room dealing, manipulation, or hidden agendas for personal gain. A person engaging in these types of political behaviors is said to be engaging in self-serving behavior that is not sanctioned by the organization.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn13_036">Ferris, G. R., Frink, D. D., Galang, M. C., Zhou, J., Kacmar, K. M., &amp; Howard, J. L. (1996).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch13_s03_s01_p05">Examples of these self-serving behaviors include bypassing the chain of command to get approval for a special project, going through improper channels to obtain special favors, or lobbying high-level managers just before they make a promotion decision. These types of actions undermine fairness in the organization, because not everyone engages in politicking to meet their own objectives. Those who follow proper procedures often feel jealous and resentful because they perceive unfair distributions of the organization's resources, including rewards and recognition.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn13_037">Parker, C.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch13_s03_s01_p07">The negative side of organizational politics is more likely to flare up in times of organizational change or when there are difficult decisions to be made and a scarcity of resources that breeds competition among organizational groups. To minimize overly political behavior, company leaders can provide equal access to information, model collaborative behavior, and demonstrate that political maneuvering will not be rewarded or tolerated. Furthermore, leaders should encourage managers throughout the organization to provide high levels of feedback to employees about their performance. High levels of feedback reduce the perception of organizational politics and improve employee morale and work performance.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn13_043">Rosen, C., Levy, P., &amp; Hall, R.

Organizations that are driven by unhealthy levels of political behavior suffer from lowered employee organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and performance as well as higher levels of job anxiety and depression. Individual antecedents of political behavior include political skill, internal locus of control, high investment in the organization, and expectations of success. Organizational antecedents include scarcity of resources, role ambiguity, frequent performance evaluations and promotions, and democratic decision making.</p>
