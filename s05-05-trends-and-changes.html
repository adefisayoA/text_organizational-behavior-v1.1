            <h2 class="title editable block">Ethical Challenges</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch01_s04_s01_s01_p01">Business ethics refers to applying ethical principles to situations that arise at work. It feels like it’s been one ethical scandal after the other. Enron Corp., AIG, Tyco International, WorldCom, and Halliburton Energy Services have all been examples of what can be described in terms ranging from poor judgment to outright illegal behavior. The immediate response by government has been the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which went into effect in 2002. This act consists of 11 different requirements aimed at greater accountability, which companies must comply with in terms of financial reporting. And while there may be some benefit to businesses from complying with these rules,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn01_016">Wagner, S., &amp; Dittmar, L. (2006, April). The unexpected benefits of Sarbanes-Oxley. <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em>, <em class="emphasis">84</em>, 133–140.</span> few see this as the long-term solution to dealing with unethical behavior. The challenge is to continue to think about business ethics on a day-to-day basis and institute cultures that support ethical decision making. The opportunity for organizations to be on the forefront of ethical thinking and actions is wide open. OB research finds that the most important determinant of whether a company acts ethically is not necessarily related to the policies and rules regarding ethical conduct but instead whether it has a culture of consistently ethical behavior and if leaders are committed to this ethical behavior.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn01_017">Driscoll, K., &amp; McKee, M.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch01_s04_s01_s02_p01">Studies suggest that fostering engagement, a concept related to passion, in employees has a significant impact on the corporate bottom line.

They are not just passionate or proud. They have a line-of-sight on their own future and on the organization’s mission and goals. They are ‘enthused’ and ‘in gear’ using their talents and discretionary effort to make a difference in their employer’s quest for sustainable business success.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn01_019">BlessingWhite.

The nexus of increasing personal computing power, the Internet, as well as nanotechnology are allowing things to be created that weren’t even imaginable 50 years ago. And the rate of technological change is not expected to slow down anytime soon. Gordon Moore, a cofounder of Intel Corp., shocked the world in 1975 with what is now termed Moore’s Law, which states that computing power doubles every 2 years. This explains why a 4-year-old computer can barely keep up with the latest video game you have purchased. As computers get faster, new software is written to capitalize on the increased computing power. We are also more connected by technology than ever before. It is now possible to send and receive e-mails or text messages with your coworkers and customers regardless of where in the world you are.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch01_s04_s01_s04_p01">Thomas Friedman’s book <em class="emphasis">The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century</em> makes the point that the Internet has “flattened” the world and created an environment in which there is a more level playing field in terms of access to information. This access to information has led to an increase in innovation, as knowledge can be shared instantly across time zones and cultures. It has also created intense competition, as the speed of business is growing faster and faster all the time. In his book <em class="emphasis">Wikinomics</em>, Don Tapscott notes that mass collaboration has changed the way work gets done, how products are created, and the ability of people to work together without ever meeting.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch01_s04_s01_s04_p02">There are few barriers to information today, which has created huge opportunities around the globe. Marc Andreessen, cofounder of Netscape Communications Corporation, notes, “Today, the most profound thing to me is the fact that a 14-year-old in Romania or Bangalore or the Soviet Union or Vietnam has all the information, all the tools, all the software easily available to apply knowledge however they want.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn01_024">Friedman, T.

Those subscribing to the triple bottom line believe that beyond economic viability, businesses need to perform well socially and environmentally.

Wal-Mart hired Adam Werbach, the former president of the Sierra Club, to help train 1.3 million North American Wal-Mart employees about sustainability.

Having never known anything different, this population has technology embedded in their lives. In addition, they value teamwork, feedback, and challenging work that allows them to develop new skills. If you are in this generation or know those who are, you know there is an expectation of immediate interaction.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn01_029">Oblinger, D. (2003).

He predicts that this is where organizations are headed in the future. The darker side of the changing trend in organization composition revolves around potential unemployment issues as companies move toward a shamrock layout. Fortunately, this shift also presents an opportunity for organizations to staff more flexibly and for employees to consider the tradeoffs between consistent, full-time work within a single organization versus the changing nature of work as a temporary employee, contract worker, or consultant—especially while developing a career in a new industry, in which increased exposure to various organizations can help an individual get up to speed in a short amount of time. The challenge for organizational behavior is managing teams consisting of different nationalities separated not only by culture and language but also in time and space.</p>
