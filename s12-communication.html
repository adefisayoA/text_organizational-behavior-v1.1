<span class="title-prefix">8.1</span> You’ve Got Mail…and You’re Fired! The Case of RadioShack</h2>
    <div class="callout block" id="fwk-122425-ch08a_s01_n01">

        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch08a_s01_p01">No one likes to receive bad news, and few like to give it. In what is heralded as one of the biggest human resources blunders of 2006, one company found a way around the discomfort of firing someone face-to-face. A total of 400 employees at the Fort Worth, Texas, headquarters of RadioShack Corporation (NYSE: RSH) got the ultimate e-mail message early one Tuesday morning. The message simply said, “The work force reduction notification is currently in progress. Unfortunately, your position is one that has been eliminated.” Company officials argued that using electronic notification was faster and allowed more privacy than breaking the news in person, and additionally, those employees who were laid off received generous severance packages. Organizational consultant Ken Siegel disagrees, proclaiming, “The bottom line is this: To almost everyone who observes or reads this, it represents a stupefying new low in the annals of management practice.” It’s unclear what, if any, the long-term effect will be for RadioShack. It isn’t just RadioShack that finds it challenging to deal with letting employees go. Terminating employees can be a painful job for many managers. The communication that takes place requires careful preparation and substantial levels of skill. <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em> ethics columnist Bruce Weinstein suggests that anyone who is involved with communicating with downsized employees has an ethical responsibility to do it correctly, which includes doing it in person, doing it privately, giving the person your full attention, being honest but sensitive, and not rushing the person. Some organizations outsource the job of letting someone go to “terminators” who handle this difficult task for them. In fact, <em class="emphasis">Up in the Air</em>, the 2009 movie starring George Clooney that was nominated for six Oscars, chronicles changes at a workforce reduction firm and highlights many of these issues.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch08a_s01_p02">Downsizing has been referred to using many euphemisms (language that softens the sound of the word) for termination. Here are just a few ways to say you’re about to lose your job without saying you’ve been fired:</p>

        </ul>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch08a_s01_p03">Regardless of how it’s done or what it’s called, is downsizing effective for organizations? Jeffrey Pfeffer, a faculty member at Stanford and best-selling author, argues no:</p>
        <span class="blockquote" id="fwk-122425-ch08a_s01_bl01">
            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch08a_s01_p04">“Contrary to popular belief, companies that announce layoffs do not enjoy higher stock prices than peers—either immediately or over time. A study of 141 layoff announcements between 1979 and 1997 found negative stock returns to companies announcing layoffs, with larger and permanent layoffs leading to greater negative effects. An examination of 1,445 downsizing announcements between 1990 and 1998 also reported that downsizing had a negative effect on stock-market returns, and the negative effects were larger the greater the extent of the downsizing. Yet another study comparing 300 layoff announcements in the United States and 73 in Japan found that in both countries, there were negative abnormal shareholder returns following the announcement.”</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch08a_s01_p05">He further notes that evidence doesn’t support the idea that layoffs increase individual company productivity either: “A study of productivity changes between 1977 and 1987 in more than 140,000 U.S. companies using Census of Manufacturers data found that companies that enjoyed the greatest increases in productivity were just as likely to have added workers as they were to have downsized.”</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s01_p03">Poor communication can also lead to lawsuits. For example, you might think that malpractice suits are filed against doctors based on the outcome of their treatments alone. But a 1997 study of malpractice suits found that a primary influence on whether or not a doctor is sued is the doctor’s communication style. While the combination of a bad outcome and patient unhappiness can quickly lead to litigation, a warm, personal communication style leads to greater patient satisfaction. Simply put, satisfied patients are less likely to sue.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_005">Communications skills cut malpractice risk—study reveals most important reason that patients decide to file malpractice suits is because of poor communication by physicians and not medical errors.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s01_p04">In business, poor communication costs money and wastes time.

Failure to communicate costly for companies. <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, p. 1A.</span> In contrast, effective communication is an asset for organizations and individuals alike. Effective communication skills, for example, are an asset for job seekers. A recent study of recruiters at 85 business schools ranked communication and interpersonal skills as the highest skills they were looking for, with 89% of the recruiters saying they were important.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_007">Alsop, R.

Surveys find that when employees think their organizations do a good job of keeping them informed about matters that affect them and when they have access to the information they need to do their jobs, they are more satisfied with their employers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_008">What are the bottom line results of communicating?

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s01_s01_p01">Communication fulfills three main functions within an organization, including coordination, transmission of information, and sharing emotions and feelings. All these functions are vital to a successful organization. The coordination of effort within an organization helps people work toward the same goals. Transmitting information is a vital part of this process. Sharing emotions and feelings bonds teams and unites people in times of celebration and crisis. Effective communication helps people grasp issues, build rapport with coworkers, and achieve consensus. So, how can we communicate effectively? The first step is to understand the communication process.</p>

Some examples of filtering include a manager’s keeping a division’s negative sales figures from a superior, in this case, the vice president. The old saying, “Don’t shoot the messenger!” illustrates the tendency of receivers to vent their negative response to unwanted messages to the sender. A gatekeeper (the vice president’s assistant, perhaps) who doesn’t pass along a complete message is also filtering. Additionally, the vice president may delete the e-mail announcing the quarter’s sales figures before reading it, blocking the message before it arrives.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s02_s01_s01_p02">As you can see, filtering prevents members of an organization from getting the complete picture of a situation. To maximize your chances of sending and receiving effective communications, it’s helpful to deliver a message in multiple ways and to seek information from multiple sources. In this way, the impact of any one person’s filtering will be diminished.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s02_s01_s01_p03">Since people tend to filter bad news more during upward communication, it is also helpful to remember that those below you in an organization may be wary of sharing bad news. One way to defuse this tendency to filter is to reward employees who clearly convey information upward, regardless of whether the news is good or bad.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s02_s01_s01_p04">Here are some of the criteria that individuals may use when deciding whether to filter a message or pass it on:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s02_s01_s01_l01">

Since Bill found the to-do list from his boss to be unreasonably demanding, he assumed the request could wait. (How else could he do everything else on the list?) The boss, assuming that Bill had heard the urgency in her request, assumed that Bill would place the order before returning to previously stated tasks. Both members of this organization were using selective perception to evaluate the communication. Bill’s perception was that the task could wait. The boss’s perception was that a time frame was clear, though unstated. When two selective perceptions collide, a misunderstanding occurs.</p>

The supplier on the other end of the phone line has just given him a choice among the products and delivery dates he requested. Bill realizes he missed hearing the first two options, but he doesn’t have time to ask the supplier to repeat them all or to try reconnecting with him at a later time. He chooses the third option—at least he heard that one, he reasons, and it seemed fair. How good was Bill’s decision amidst all the information he was processing at the same time?</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s02_s01_s04_p01">An effective communication requires a sender and a receiver who are open to speaking and listening to one another, despite possible differences in opinion or personality. One or both parties may have to put their emotions aside to achieve the goal of communicating clearly. A receiver who is emotionally upset tends to ignore or distort what the sender is saying.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s02_s01_s05_p01">Have you ever told a joke that fell flat? You and the receiver lacked the common context that could have made it funny. (Or yes, it could have just been a lousy joke.) Sarcasm and irony are subtle and, therefore, they are potentially hurtful commodities in business. It’s best to keep these types of communications out of the workplace, as their benefits are limited, and their potential dangers are great. Lack of familiarity with the sender can lead to misinterpreting humor, especially in less-rich information channels such as e-mail. For example, an e-mail from Jill that ends with, “Men should be boiled in vats of oil,” could be interpreted as antimale if the receiver didn’t know that Jill has a penchant for exaggeration and always jokes to let off steam. Similarly, if the sender lacks credibility or is untrustworthy, the message will not get through. Receivers may be suspicious of the sender’s motivations (Why is she telling me this?). Likewise, if the sender has communicated erroneous information in the past or has created false emergencies, the current message may be filtered.</p>

Its grassroots structure gives it greater credibility in the minds of employees than information delivered through official channels, even when that information is false. Some downsides of the office grapevine are that gossip offers politically minded insiders a powerful tool for disseminating communication (and self-promoting miscommunications) within an organization. In addition, the grapevine lacks a specific sender, which can create a sense of distrust among employees: Who is at the root of the gossip network? When the news is volatile, suspicions may arise as to the person or person behind the message. Managers who understand the grapevine’s power can use it to send and receive messages of their own. They can also decrease the grapevine’s power by sending official messages quickly and accurately, should big news arise.</p>

This is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">semantics</a><span class="glossdef">The meaning of a word or phrase.</span></span>. For example, companies often have their own acronyms and buzzwords (called business <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">jargon</a><span class="glossdef">A specific set of acronyms or words unique to a specific group or profession.</span></span>) that are clear to them but impenetrable to outsiders. For example, at IBM, GBS is focusing on BPTS, using expertise acquired from the PwC purchase (which had to be sold to avoid conflicts of interest in light of SOX) to fend off other BPO providers and inroads by the Bangalore tiger. Does this make sense to you? If not, here’s the translation: IBM’s Global Business Services (GBS) division is focusing on offering companies Business Process Transformation Services (BPTS), using the expertise it acquired from purchasing the management consulting and technology services arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), which had to sell the division due to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX; enacted in response to the major accounting scandals such as Enron). The added management expertise puts it above business process outsourcing (BPO) vendors who focus more on automating processes rather than transforming and improving them. Chief among these BPO competitors is Wipro, often called the “Bangalore tiger” because of its geographic origin and aggressive growth. Given the amount of messages we send and receive everyday, it makes sense that humans would try to find a shortcut—a way to communicate things in code. In business, this code is known as jargon. Jargon is the language of specialized terms used by a group or profession. It is common shorthand among experts and if used sensibly can be a quick and efficient way of communicating. Most jargon consists of unfamiliar terms, abstract words, nonexistent words, acronyms, and abbreviations, with an occasional euphemism thrown in for good measure. Every profession, trade, and organization has its own specialized terms.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_017">Wright, N. (n.d.). Keep it jargon-free.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s02_s01_s07_p02">At first glance, jargon sounds like a good thing—a quicker way to send an effective communication similar to the way text message abbreviations can send common messages in a shorter, yet understandable way. But that’s not always how things happen. Jargon can be an obstacle to effective communication, causing listeners to tune out or fostering ill feelings between partners in a conversation. When jargon rules the day, the message can get obscured. A key question to ask yourself before using a phrase of jargon is, “Who is the receiver of my message?” If you are a specialist speaking to another specialist in your area, jargon may be the best way to send a message while forging a professional bond—similar to the way best friends can communicate in code. For example, an IT technician communicating with another IT technician may use jargon as a way of sharing information in a way that reinforces the pair’s shared knowledge. But that same conversation should be held in Standard English, free of jargon, when communicating with staff members outside the IT group.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s02_s01_s10_p02">Effective communication is clear, factual, and goal-oriented. It is also respectful. Referring to a person by one adjective (a <em class="emphasis">brain</em>, a <em class="emphasis">diabetic</em>) reduces the person to that one characteristic. Language that inflames or stereotypes a person poisons the communication process. Language that insults an individual or group based on age, ethnicity, sexual preference, or political beliefs violates public and private standards of decency, ranging from civil rights to corporate regulations.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s02_s01_s10_p03">The effort to create a neutral set of terms to refer to heritage and preferences has resulted in a debate over the nature of “political correctness.” Proponents of political correctness see it as a way to defuse the volatile nature of words that stereotyped groups and individuals in the past. Critics of political correctness see its vocabulary as stilted and needlessly cautious.</p>

But the receiver’s ability to listen effectively is equally vital to successful communication. The average worker spends 55% of their workdays listening. Managers listen up to 70% each day. Unfortunately, listening doesn’t lead to understanding in every case.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s02_s01_s11_p03">From a number of different perspectives, listening matters. Former Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca lamented, “I only wish I could find an institute that teaches people how to listen. After all, a good manager needs to listen at least as much as he needs to talk.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_021">Iacocca, L., &amp; Novak, W.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s02_s01_s11_p04">Listening clearly matters. Listening takes practice, skill, and concentration. Alan Gulick, a Starbucks Corporation spokesperson, believes better listening can improve profits. If every Starbucks employee misheard one $10 order each day, their errors would cost the company a billion dollars annually. To teach its employees to listen, Starbucks created a code that helps employees taking orders hear the size, flavor, and use of milk or decaffeinated coffee. The person making the drink echoes the order aloud.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s02_s01_s11_s01_p01">Cicero said, “Silence is one of the great arts of conversation.” How often have we been in a conversation with someone else when we are not really listening but itching to convey our portion? This behavior is known as “rehearsing.” It suggests the receiver has no intention of considering the sender’s message and is actually preparing to respond to an earlier point instead. Effective communication relies on another kind of listening: active listening.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s02_s01_s11_s01_p02">Active listening can be defined as giving full attention to what other people are saying, taking time to understand the points being made, asking questions as needed, and not interrupting at inappropriate times.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_023">O*NET Resource Center, the nation’s primary source of occupational information accessed at <a class="link" href="http://online.onetcenter.org/skills/">http://online.onetcenter.org/skills/</a>.</span> Active listening creates a real-time relationship between the sender and receiver by acknowledging the content and receipt of a message. As we’ve seen in the Starbucks example above, repeating and confirming a message’s content offers a way to confirm that the correct content is flowing between colleagues. The process creates a bond between coworkers while increasing the flow and accuracy of messaging.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s02_s01_s11_s02_p01">Carl Rogers gave five rules for active listening:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s02_s01_s11_s02_l01">

                    <li>Respond to feelings.</li>

                    <li>Paraphrase and restate.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s02_s01_s11_s02_p02">The good news is that listening is a skill that can be learned.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_024">Brownell, J. (1990). Perceptions of effective listeners: A management study. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Business Communications</em>, <em class="emphasis">27</em>, 401–415.</span> The first step is to decide that we want to listen. Casting aside distractions, such as by reducing background or internal noise, is critical. The receiver takes in the sender’s message silently, without speaking.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s02_s01_s11_s02_p03">Second, throughout the conversation, show the speaker that you’re listening. You can do this nonverbally by nodding your head and keeping your attention focused on the speaker. You can also do it verbally, by saying things like, “Yes,” “That’s interesting,” or other such verbal cues. As you’re listening, pay attention to the sender’s body language for additional cues about how they’re feeling. Interestingly, silence has a role in active listening. During active listening, we are trying to understand what has been said, and in silence we can consider the implications. We can’t consider information and object to it at the same time. That’s where the power of silence comes into play. Finally, if anything is not clear to you, ask questions. Confirm that you’ve heard the message accurately, by repeating back a crucial piece like, “Great, I’ll see you at 2:00 p.m. in my office.” At the end of the conversation, a thank you from both parties is an optional but highly effective way of acknowledging each other’s teamwork.</p>

It strengthens personal investment in the information being shared. It also forges healthy working relationships among colleagues by making speakers and listeners equally valued members of the communication process.</p>

                        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Start by stopping</em>. Take a moment to inhale and exhale quietly before you begin to listen. Your job as a listener is to receive information openly and accurately.</li>
                        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Don’t worry about what you’ll say when the time comes</em>. Silence can be a beautiful thing.</li>
                        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Join the sender’s team</em>. When the sender pauses, summarize what you believe has been said. “What I’m hearing is that we need to focus on marketing as well as sales. Is that correct?” Be attentive to physical as well as verbal communications. “I hear you saying that we should focus on marketing, but the way you’re shaking your head tells me the idea may not really appeal to you—is that right?”</li>
                        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Don’t multitask while listening</em>. Listening is a full-time job. It’s tempting to multitask when you and the sender are in different places, but doing that is counterproductive. The human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. Listening with only part of your brain increases the chances that you’ll have questions later, ultimately requiring more of the speaker’s time. (And when the speaker is in the same room, multitasking signals a disinterest that is considered rude.)</li>
                        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Try to empathize with the sender’s point of view</em>. You don’t have to agree, but can you find common ground?</li>
                        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Confused</em>? <em class="emphasis">Ask questions</em>. There’s nothing wrong with admitting you haven’t understood the sender’s point. You may even help the sender clarify the message.</li>
                        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Establish eye contact. Making eye contact</em> with the speaker (if appropriate for the culture) is important.</li>
                        <li>
<em class="emphasis">What is the goal of this communication</em>? Ask yourself this question at different points during the communication to keep the information flow on track. Be polite. Differences in opinion can be the starting point of consensus.</li>
                        <li>
<em class="emphasis">It’s great to be surprised</em>. Listen with an open mind, not just for what you <em class="emphasis">want</em> to hear.</li>
                        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Pay attention to what is not said</em>. Does the sender’s body language seem to contradict the message? If so, clarification may be in order.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_p01">There are three types of communication, including: verbal communication involving listening to a person to understand the meaning of a message, written communication in which a message is read, and nonverbal communication involving observing a person and inferring meaning. Let’s start with verbal communication, which is the most common form of communication.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Verbal Communication</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p01">Verbal communications in business take place over the phone or in person. The medium of the message is oral. Let’s return to our printer cartridge example. This time, the message is being conveyed from the sender (the manager) to the receiver (an employee named Bill) by telephone. We’ve already seen how the manager’s request to Bill (“Buy more printer toner cartridges!”) can go awry. Now let’s look at how the same message can travel successfully from sender to receiver.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p02">Manager (speaking on the phone): “Good morning Bill!”</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p06">Manager: “Our next step is to order more printer toner cartridges. Would you place an order for 1,000 printer toner cartridges with Jones Computer Supplies? Our budget for this purchase is $30,000, and the printer toner cartridges need to be here by Wednesday afternoon.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p07">(<em class="emphasis">The manager breaks down the task into several steps. Each step consists of a specific task, time frame, quantity, or goal</em>.)</p>

Stories can help clarify key values and also help demonstrate how certain tasks are performed within an organization.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p11">While the process may be the same, high stakes communications require more planning, reflection, and skill than normal day-to-day interactions at work. Examples of high stakes communication events include asking for a raise or presenting a business plan to a venture capitalist. In addition to these events, there are also many times in our professional lives when we have <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">crucial conversations</a><span class="glossdef">Discussions in which the stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions run strong.</span></span>, which are defined as discussions in which not only are the stakes high, but also the opinions vary and emotions run strong.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_027">Patterson, K., Grenny, J., McMillan, R., &amp; Switzler, A. (2002). <em class="emphasis">Crucial conversations: Tools for talking when stakes are high</em>. New York: McGraw-Hill.</span> One of the most consistent recommendations from communications experts is to work toward using <em class="emphasis">“and”</em> instead of <em class="emphasis">“but”</em> when communicating under these circumstances. In addition, be aware of your communication style and practice being flexible; it is under stressful situations that communication styles can become the most rigid.</p>

<em class="emphasis">Think before you speak</em>. Our impulse is often to imitate movies by offering fast, witty replies in conversation. In the real world, a careful silence can make us sound more intelligent and prevent mistakes.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be receptive to new ideas</em>. If you disagree with another person’s opinion, saying, “Tell me more,” can be a more useful way of moving forward than saying, “That’s stupid!”</li>

<em class="emphasis">Repeat someone’s name to yourself and then aloud, when being introduced</em>. The form of the name you use may vary. First names work with peers. Mr. or Ms. is common when meeting superiors in business.</li>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Written Communication</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p01">In contrast to verbal communications, which are oral, written business communications are <em class="emphasis">printed messages</em>. Examples of written communications include memos, proposals, e-mails, letters, training manuals, and operating policies. They may be printed on paper or appear on the screen. Written communication is often asynchronous. That is, the sender can write a message that the receiver can read at any time, unlike a conversation that is carried on in real time. A written communication can also be read by many people (such as all employees in a department or all customers). It’s a “one-to-many” communication, as opposed to a one-to-one conversation. There are exceptions, of course: A voice mail is an oral message that is asynchronous. Conference calls and speeches are oral one-to-many communications, and e-mails can have only one recipient or many.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p02">Normally, a verbal communication takes place in real time. Written communication, by contrast, can be constructed over a longer period of time. It also can be collaborative. Multiple people can contribute to the content on one document before that document is sent to the intended audience.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p03">Verbal and written communications have different strengths and weaknesses. In business, the decision to communicate verbally or in written form can be a powerful one. As we’ll see below, each style of communication has particular strengths and pitfalls. When determining whether to communicate verbally or in writing, ask yourself: <em class="emphasis">Do I want to convey facts or feelings</em>? Verbal communications are a better way to convey feelings. Written communications do a better job of conveying facts.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p04">Picture a manager making a speech to a team of 20 employees. The manager is speaking at a normal pace. The employees appear interested. But how much information is being transmitted? Probably not as much as the speaker believes. The fact is that humans listen much faster than they speak. The average public speaker communicates at a speed of about 125 words a minute, and that pace sounds fine to the audience. (In fact, anything faster than that probably would sound unusual. To put that figure in perspective, someone having an excited conversation speaks at about 150 words a minute.) Based on these numbers, we could assume that the audience has more than enough time to take in each word the speaker delivers, which actually creates a problem. The average person in the audience can hear 400 to 500 words a minute.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_028">Lee, D., &amp; Hatesohl, D. <em class="emphasis">Listening: Our most used communication skill</em>.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p05">As you can see, oral communication is the most often used form of communication, but it is also an inherently flawed medium for conveying specific facts. Listeners’ minds wander. It’s nothing personal—in fact, it’s a completely normal psychological occurrence. In business, once we understand this fact, we can make more intelligent communication choices based on the kind of information we want to convey.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s03_p05">Now you can see how changing the tone of voice in a conversation can incite or diffuse a misunderstanding. For another example, imagine that you’re a customer interested in opening a new bank account. At one bank, the bank officer is dressed neatly. She looks you in the eye when she speaks. Her tone is friendly. Her words are easy to understand, yet professional sounding. “Thank you for considering Bank of the East Coast. We appreciate this opportunity and would love to explore ways that we can work together to help your business grow,” she says with a friendly smile. At the second bank, the bank officer’s tie is stained. He looks over your head and down at his desk as he speaks. He shifts in his seat and fidgets with his hands. His words say, “Thank you for considering Bank of the West Coast. We appreciate this opportunity and would love to explore ways that we can work together to help you business grow,” but he mumbles his words, and his voice conveys no enthusiasm or warmth. Which bank would you choose? The speaker’s body language must match his or her words. If a sender’s words and body language don’t match—if a sender smiles while telling a sad tale, for example—the mismatch between verbal and nonverbal cues can cause a receiver to actively dislike the sender.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s01_s03_p06">Following are a few examples of nonverbal cues that can support or detract from a sender’s message.</p>

Sincerity is vital for effective communication. In some cultures, a firm handshake, given with a warm, dry hand, is a great way to establish trust. A weak, clammy handshake might convey a lack of trustworthiness. Gnawing one’s lip conveys uncertainty. A direct smile conveys confidence.</p>

Happiness is associated with an upturned mouth and slightly closed eyes; fear with an open mouth and wide-eyed stare. Shifty eyes and pursed lips convey a lack of trustworthiness. The impact of facial expressions in conversation is instantaneous. Our brains may register them as “a feeling” about someone’s character. For this reason, it is important to consider how we appear in business as well as what we say. The muscles of our faces convey our emotions. We can send a silent message without saying a word. A change in facial expression can change our emotional state. Before an interview, for example, if we focus on feeling confident, our face will convey that confidence to an interviewer. Adopting a smile (even if we’re feeling stressed) can reduce the body’s stress levels.</p>

Head up, back straight (but not rigid) implies an upright character. In interview situations, experts advise mirroring an interviewer’s tendency to lean in and settle back in a seat. The subtle repetition of the other person’s posture conveys that we are listening and responding.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s02_p04">Like face-to-face and telephone conversations, videoconferencing has high information richness, because receivers and senders can see or hear beyond just the words that are used—they can see the sender’s body language or hear the tone of their voice. Handheld devices, blogs, and written letters and memos offer medium-rich channels, because they convey words and pictures or photos. Formal written documents, such as legal documents and budget spreadsheets, convey the least richness, because the format is often rigid and standardized. As a result, the tone of the message is often lost.</p>

As we saw in the chart above, e-mail is a medium-rich channel. It can convey facts quickly. But when it comes to emotion, e-mail’s flaws make it a far less desirable choice than oral communication—the 55% of nonverbal cues that make a conversation comprehensible to a listener are missing. Researchers also note that e-mail readers don’t pick up on sarcasm and other tonal aspects of writing as much as the writer believes they will.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_041">Kruger, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s02_p07">The sender may believe that certain emotional signifiers have been included in a message. But, with written words alone, those signifiers are not there. This gap between the form and content of e-mail inspired the rise of emoticons—symbols that offer clues to the emotional side of the words in each message. Generally speaking, however, emoticons are not considered professional in business communication.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s02_p08">You might feel uncomfortable conveying an emotionally laden message verbally, especially when the message contains unwanted news. Sending an e-mail to your staff that there will be no bonuses this year may seem easier than breaking the bad news face-to-face, but that doesn’t mean that e-mail is an effective or appropriate way to break this kind of news. When the message is emotional, the sender should use verbal communication. Indeed, a good rule of thumb is that more emotionally laden messages require more thought in the choice of channel and how they are communicated.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s03_p01">Information can move horizontally, from a sender to a receiver, as we’ve seen. It can also move vertically, down from top management, or up from the front line. Information can also move diagonally between and among levels of an organization, such as a message from a customer service rep to a manager in the manufacturing department or a message from the chief financial officer sent down to all department heads.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s03_p03">The organizational status of the sender can impact the receiver’s attentiveness to the message. For example, consider the following: A senior manager sends a memo to a production supervisor. The supervisor, who has a lower status within the organization, is likely to pay close attention to the message. The same information conveyed in the opposite direction, however, might not get the attention it deserves. The message would be filtered by the senior manager’s perception of priorities and urgencies.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s04_p01">External communications deliver specific businesses messages to individuals outside an organization. They may announce changes in staff or strategy, earnings, and more. The goal of an external communication is to create a specific message that the receiver will understand and share with others. Examples of external communications include the following.</p>

These receivers, it is hoped, will share the message with others. In time, as the message is passed along, it should <em class="emphasis">appear</em> to be independent of the sender, creating the illusion of an independently generated consumer trend, public opinion, and so on.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s04_s01_p02">The message of a public relations effort may be <em class="emphasis">b2b</em> (business to business), <em class="emphasis">b2c</em> (business to consumer), or media related. The message can take different forms. Press releases try to convey a newsworthy message, real or manufactured. It may be constructed like a news item, inviting editors or reporters to reprint the message in part or as a whole, with or without acknowledgement of the sender’s identity. Public relations campaigns create messages over time through contests, special events, trade shows, and media interviews in addition to press releases.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s04_s02_p01">Advertising places external business messages before target receivers through media buys. A media buy is a fee that is paid to a television network, Web site, magazine, and so on by an advertiser to insert an advertisement. The fee is based on the perceived value of the audience who watches, reads, listens to, or frequents the space where the ad will appear.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s04_s02_p02">In recent years, receivers have begun to filter advertiser’s messages. This phenomenon is perceived to be a result of the large amount of ads the average person sees each day and a growing level of consumer wariness of paid messaging. Advertisers, in turn, are trying to create alternative forms of advertising that receivers won’t filter. The <em class="emphasis">advertorial</em> is one example of an external communication that combines the look of an article with the focused message of an ad. Product placements in videos, movies, and games are other ways that advertisers strive to reach receivers with commercial messages.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s03_s04_s03_p01">A Web page’s external communication can combine elements of public relations, advertising, and editorial content, reaching receivers on multiple levels and in multiple ways. Banner ads, blogs, and advertiser-driven “click-through” areas are just a few of the elements that allow a business to deliver a message to a receiver online. The perceived flexibility of online communications can impart a less formal (and therefore, more believable) quality to an external communication. A message relayed in a daily blog post, for example, will reach a receiver differently than if it is delivered in an annual report. The popularity and power of blogs is growing, with 11% of <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 500 companies having official blogs (up from 4% in 2005). In fact, blogs have become so important to companies such as Coca-Cola Company, Eastman Kodak Company, and Marriott International Inc. that they have created official positions within their organizations titled “chief blogging officer.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_045">Chief blogging officer title catching on with corporations.

Despite a “spontaneous” feel, many online pages can be revisited many times in a single day. For this reason, clear and accurate external communications are as vital for online use as they are in traditional media.</p>

The Exxon Valdez disaster is a classic example of ineffective crisis management and communication. When millions of barrels of oil spilled into Prince William Sound, the company’s poor response only added to the damage. Exxon Mobil Corporation executives refused to acknowledge the extent of the problem and declined to comment on the accident for almost a week. Exxon also sent a succession of lower level spokespeople to deal with the media.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_047">Holusha, J. (1989, April 4).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s04_s01_p03">Instead, a more effective method of crisis communication is to have the company’s highest ranking official become the spokesperson who communicates the situation.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s04_s02_p01">Culture is a shared set of beliefs and experiences common to people in a specific setting. The setting that creates a culture can be geographic, religious, or professional. As you might guess, the same individual can be a member of many cultures, all of which may play a part in the interpretation of certain words.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s04_s02_p02">The different and often “multicultural” identity of individuals in the same organization can lead to some unexpected and potentially large miscommunications. For example, during the Cold War, Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev told the American delegation at the United Nations, “We will bury you!” His words were interpreted as a threat of nuclear annihilation. However, a more accurate reading of Khruschev’s words would have been, “We will overtake you!” meaning economic superiority. The words, as well as the fear and suspicion that the West had of the Soviet Union at the time, led to the more alarmist and sinister interpretation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn08_049">Garner, E.

For example, when speaking with nonnative English-speaking colleagues, avoid “isn’t it?” questions. This sentence construction does not exist in many other languages and can be confusing for nonnative English speakers.

This is a norm we consider basic and essential. This is not the case among the Chinese.

With more than 10,000 offices across the United States and Canada, they are able to serve nearly 7 million investors. This is the 10th year Edward Jones has made the Best Companies list. In addition, Edward Jones ranked highest with client satisfaction among full-service investment firms, according to an annual survey released by J. D. Power and Associates in 2009. How has Edward Jones maintained this favorable reputation in the eyes of both its employees and its customers?</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch08b_s01_p02">It begins with the perks offered, including profit sharing and telecommuting. But if you ask the company’s CEO, Tim Kirley, he will likely tell you that it goes beyond the financial incentives, and at the heart of it is the culture of honest communication that he adamantly promotes. Kirley works with senior managers and team members in what makes up an open floor plan and always tries to maintain his approachability. Examples of this include direct communication, letters to staff and video, and Internet-posted talks. In addition, regular meetings are held to celebrate achievements and reinforce the firm’s ethos. Staff surveys are frequently administered and feedback is widely taken into consideration so that the 10,000 employees feel heard and respected.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch08b_s01_p03">According to <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>’s managing editor, Hank Gilman, “The most important considerations for this year’s list were hiring and the ways in which companies are helping their employees weather the recession.” Edward Jones was able to persevere through the trauma of the recent financial crisis with no layoffs and an 8% one-year job growth. While a salary freeze was enacted, profit sharing continued. Kirley insists that the best approach to the recent economic downturn is to remain honest with his employees even when the news he is delivering is not what they want to hear.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch08b_s01_p04">Edward Jones was established in 1922 by Edward D. Jones Sr., and long ago, the company recognized the importance of a satisfied workforce and how that has the ability to translate into customer satisfaction and long-term growth. The company’s internal policy of open communication seems to carry over to how advisors value their relationship with individual customers. Investors are most likely to contact their advisor by directly visiting them at a local branch or by picking up the phone and calling them. Edward Jones’s managing partner, Jim Weddle, explains it best himself: “We are able to stay focused on the long-term because we are a partnership and we know who we are and what we do. When you respect the people who work here, you take care of them—not just in the good times, but in the difficult times as well.”</p>

<span class="title-prefix">8.7</span> Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s05_p01">In this chapter we have reviewed why effective communication matters to organizations. Communication may break down as a result of many communication barriers that may be attributed to the sender or receiver. Therefore, effective communication requires familiarity with the barriers. Choosing the right channel for communication is also important, because choosing the wrong medium undermines the message. When communication occurs in the cross-cultural context, extra caution is needed, given that different cultures have different norms regarding nonverbal communication, and different words will be interpreted differently across cultures. By being sensitive to the errors outlined in this chapter and adopting active listening skills, you may increase your communication effectiveness.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch08_s06_p01">In 2006, Hewlett-Packard Development Company LP became embroiled in a controversy over methods used to investigate media leaks from its board. HP Chairperson Patricia Dunn could have simply asked the directors who was the source cited in the story, sought an apology, and gone from there. With some direct face-to-face communication, the story would likely have ended quickly. It did not. “Not only did investigators impersonate board members, employees and journalists to obtain their phone records, but according to multiple reports, they also surveilled an HP director and a reporter for CNet Networks Inc. They sent monitoring spyware in an e-mail to that reporter by concocting a phony tip. They even snooped on the phone records of former CEO and Chairperson Carly Fiorina, who had launched the quest to identify media sources in the first place.” The situation continued to escalate. For example, the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> reported that HP consultants even considered planting clerical or custodial workers at CNet and the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em> to learn who was leaking information to them. Following this, Patricia Dunn, as well as three executives, left the company. A congressional hearing and several federal investigations later, executives were charged with felonies, and HP paid $14.5 million to settle civil charges related to the scandal. HP is not the only company to use such methods; recent admissions by the investigation firms involved suggest that the use of ethically questionable investigative tactics by large companies is quite common. “It betrays a type of corporate culture that is so self-obsessed, (that) really considers itself not only above the law, but above, I think, ethical decency, that you have to ask yourself, where did the shame come in?” said Charles King, an analyst with Pund-IT Inc.</p>
