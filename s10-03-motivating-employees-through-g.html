            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p01">Effective goals are specific and measurable. For example, “increasing sales to a region by 10%” is a specific goal, whereas deciding to “delight customers” is not specific or measurable. When goals are specific, performance tends to be higher.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_039">Tubbs, M. E. (1986). Goal setting: A meta-analytic examination of the empirical evidence. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">71</em>, 474–483.</span> Why? If goals are not specific and measurable, how would you know whether you have reached the goal? A wide distribution of performance levels could potentially be acceptable. For the same reason, “doing your best” is not an effective goal, because it is not measurable and does not give you a specific target.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p02">Certain aspects of performance are easier to quantify. For example, it is relatively easy to set specific goals for productivity, sales, number of defects, or turnover rates. However, not everything that is easy to measure should be measured. Moreover, some of the most important elements of someone’s performance may not be easily quantifiable (such as employee or customer satisfaction). So how do you set specific and measurable goals for these soft targets? Even though some effort will be involved, metrics such as satisfaction can and should be quantified. For example, you could design a survey for employees and customers to track satisfaction ratings from year to year.</p>

Aggressive goals are also called stretch goals. According to a Hay Group study, one factor that distinguishes companies that are ranked as “Most Admired Companies” in <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> magazine is that they set more difficult goals.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_040">Stein, N.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s02_s02_s03_p01">While goals should be difficult, they should also be based in reality. In other words, if a goal is viewed as impossible to reach, it will not have any motivational value. In fact, setting impossible goals and then punishing people for not reaching these goals is cruel and will demotivate employees.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s02_s02_s04_p01">The goal should contain a statement regarding when the proposed performance level will be reached. For example, “increasing sales to a region by 10%” is not a time-bound goal, because there is no time limit. Adding a limiter such as “by December of the current fiscal year” gives employees a sense of time urgency.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Do SMART Goals Motivate?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s02_s03_p01">There are at least four reasons why goals motivate.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_045">Latham, G. P. (2004). The motivational benefits of goal-setting. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Executive</em>, <em class="emphasis">18</em>, 126–129; Seijts, G. H., &amp; Latham, G. P. (2005).

Changing the goal-setting process at Microsoft. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Executive</em>, <em class="emphasis">18</em>, 139–142.</span> First, goals give us direction. When you have a goal of reducing shipment of defective products by 5% by September, you know that you should direct your energy toward defects. The goal tells you what to focus on. For this reason, goals should be set carefully. Giving employees goals that are not aligned with company goals will be a problem, because goals will direct employees' energies to a certain end. Second, goals energize people and tell them not to stop until the goal is accomplished. If you set goals for yourself such as “I will have a break from reading this textbook when I finish reading this section,” you will not give up until you reach the end of the section. Even if you feel tired along the way, having this specific goal will urge you to move forward. Third, having a goal provides a challenge. When people have goals and proceed to reach them, they feel a sense of accomplishment. Finally, SMART goals urge people to think outside the box and rethink how they are working. If the goal is not very difficult, it only motivates people to work faster or longer. If a goal is substantially difficult, merely working faster or longer will not get you the results. Instead, you will need to rethink the way you usually work and devise a creative way of working. It has been argued that this method resulted in designers and engineers in Japan inventing the bullet train. Having a goal that went beyond the speed capabilities of traditional trains prevented engineers from making minor improvements and inspired them to come up with a radically different concept.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_046">Kerr, S., &amp; Landauer, S.

In these situations, setting goals for behaviors and learning may be more effective than setting goals for outcomes. Second, goal setting may prevent employees from adapting and changing their behaviors in response to unforeseen threats. For example, one study found that when teams had difficult goals and employees within the team had high levels of performance expectations, teams had difficulty adapting to unforeseen circumstances.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_053">LePine, J.

This focus may lead to sacrificing other important elements of performance. If goals are set for production numbers, quality may suffer. As a result, it is important to set goals touching on all critical aspects of performance. Finally, an aggressive pursuit of goals may lead to unethical behaviors. If employees are rewarded for goal accomplishment but there are no rewards for coming very close to reaching the goal, employees may be tempted to cheat.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s02_s06_p03">Goal-setting theory is one of the most influential theories of motivation. In order to motivate employees, goals should be SMART (specific, measurable, aggressive, realistic, and time-bound). SMART goals motivate employees because they energize behavior, give it direction, provide a challenge, force employees to think outside the box, and devise new and novel methods of performing. Goals are more effective in motivating employees when employees receive feedback on their accomplishments, have the ability to perform, and are committed to goals. Poorly derived goals have the downsides of hampering learning, preventing adaptability, causing a single-minded pursuit of goals at the exclusion of other activities, and encouraging unethical behavior. Companies tie individual goals to company goals using management by objectives.</p>
