        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch01_s01_s01_p02">This book is all about people, especially people at work. As evidenced in the opening case, we will share many examples of people making their workplaces work. People can make work an exciting, fun, and productive place to be, or they can make it a routine, boring, and ineffective place where everyone dreads to go. Steve Jobs, cofounder, chairman, and CEO of Apple Inc. attributes the innovations at Apple, which include the iPod, MacBook, and iPhone, to people, noting, “Innovation has nothing to do with how many R&amp;D dollars you have.…It’s not about money. It’s about the people you have, how you’re led, and how much you get it.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn01_001">Kirkpatrick, D. (1998).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch01_s01_s01_p04">Just like people, organizations come in many shapes and sizes. We understand that the career path you will take may include a variety of different organizations. In addition, we know that each student reading this book has a unique set of personal and work-related experiences, capabilities, and career goals. On average, a person working in the United States will change jobs 10 times in 20 years.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn01_004">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. (2005).

So, this book will not be about giving you all the answers to every situation you may encounter when you start your first job or as you continue up the career ladder. Instead, this book will give you the vocabulary, framework, and critical thinking skills necessary for you to diagnose situations, ask tough questions, evaluate the answers you receive, and act in an effective and ethical manner regardless of situational characteristics.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch01_s01_s01_p05">Throughout this book, when we refer to organizations, we will include examples that may apply to diverse organizations such as publicly held, for-profit organizations like Google and American Airlines, privately owned businesses such as S. C. Johnson &amp; Son Inc. (makers of Windex glass cleaner) and Mars Inc. (makers of Snickers and M&amp;Ms), and not-for-profit organizations such as the Sierra Club or Mercy Corps, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) such as Doctors Without Borders and the International Red Cross. We will also refer to both small and large corporations. You will see examples from <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 500 organizations such as Intel Corporation or Home Depot Inc., as well as small start-up organizations. Keep in mind that some of the small organizations of today may become large organizations in the future. For example, in 1998, eBay Inc. had only 29 employees and $47.4 million in income, but by 2008 they had grown to 11,000 employees and over $7 billion in revenue.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn01_005">Gibson, E.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch01_s01_s01_p06">Together, we will examine people at work both as individuals and within work groups and how they impact and are impacted by the organizations where they work. Before we can understand these three levels of organizational behavior, we need to agree on a definition of organizational behavior.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Is Organizational Behavior?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch01_s01_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Organizational behavior (OB)</a><span class="glossdef">The systematic study and application of knowledge about how individuals and groups act within the organizations where they work.</span></span> is defined as the systematic study and application of knowledge about how individuals and groups act within the organizations where they work. As you will see throughout this book, definitions are important. They are important because they tell us what something is as well as what it is not. For example, we will not be addressing childhood development in this course—that concept is often covered in psychology—but we might draw on research about twins raised apart to understand whether job attitudes are affected by genetics.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch01_s01_s02_p02">OB draws from other disciplines to create a unique field. As you read this book, you will most likely recognize OB’s roots in other disciplines. For example, when we review topics such as personality and motivation, we will again review studies from the field of psychology. The topic of team processes relies heavily on the field of sociology. In the chapter relating to decision making, you will come across the influence of economics. When we study power and influence in organizations, we borrow heavily from political sciences. Even medical science contributes to the field of organizational behavior, particularly to the study of stress and its effects on individuals.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch01_s01_s02_p03">Those who study organizational behavior—which now includes you—are interested in several outcomes such as work attitudes (e.g., job satisfaction and organizational commitment) as well as job performance (e.g., customer service and counterproductive work behaviors). A distinction is made in OB regarding which level of the organization is being studied at any given time. There are three key <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">levels of analysis</a><span class="glossdef">In OB, includes examining the individual, the group, and the organization.</span></span> in OB. They are examining the individual, the group, and the organization. For example, if I want to understand my boss’s personality, I would be examining the individual level of analysis. If we want to know about how my manager’s personality affects my team, I am examining things at the team level. But, if I want to understand how my organization’s culture affects my boss’s behavior, I would be interested in the organizational level of analysis.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Organizational Behavior Matters</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch01_s01_s03_p01">OB matters at three critical levels. It matters because it is all about things <strong class="emphasis bold">you</strong> <strong class="emphasis bold">care</strong> about. OB can help you become a more engaged organizational member. Getting along with others, getting a great job, lowering your stress level, making more effective decisions, and working effectively within a team…these are all great things, and OB addresses them!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch01_s01_s03_p02">It matters because <strong class="emphasis bold">employers care</strong> about OB. A recent survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) asked employers which skills are the most important for them when evaluating job candidates, and OB topics topped the list.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn01_006">NACE 2007 Job Outlook Survey.

What this means is that if the average employee makes $30,000 per year, the highest potential pay for their CEO would be $570,000, which is a lot of money but pales in comparison to salaries such as Steve Jobs of Apple at $14.6 million or the highest paid CEO in 2007, Larry Ellison of Oracle, at $192.9 million.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn01_009">Elmer-DeWitt, P.

Once you understand a concept, you are better able to recognize it. Once you recognize these concepts in real-world events and understand that you have choices in how you will react, you can better manage yourself and others. An effective tool you can start today is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">journaling</a><span class="glossdef">The process of writing out thoughts and emotions on a regular basis.</span></span>, which helps you chart your progress as you learn new skills.

<em class="emphasis">What exactly is journaling</em>? Journaling refers to the process of writing out thoughts and emotions on a regular basis.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Why is journaling a good idea</em>? Journaling is an effective way to record how you are feeling from day to day. It can be a more objective way to view trends in your thoughts and emotions so you are not simply relying on your memory of past events, which can be inaccurate. Simply getting your thoughts and ideas down has been shown to have health benefits as well such as lowering the writer’s blood pressure, heart rate, and decreasing stress levels.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">How do I get started</em>? The first step is to get a journal or create a computer file where you can add new entries on a regular basis. Set a goal for how many minutes per day you want to write and stick to it. Experts say at least 10 minutes a day is needed to see benefits, with 20 minutes being ideal. The quality of what you write is also important. Write your thoughts down clearly and specifically while also conveying your emotions in your writing. After you have been writing for at least a week, go back and examine what you have written. Do you see patterns in your interactions with others? Do you see things you like and things you’d like to change about yourself? If so, great! These are the things you can work on and reflect on.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch01_s01_s05_p01">As teachers we have heard this question many times. The answer, as you might have guessed, is <em class="emphasis">no—OB is not just common sense</em>. As we noted earlier, OB is the systematic study and application of knowledge about how individuals and groups act within the organizations where they work. <em class="emphasis">Systematic</em> is an important word in this definition. It is easy to think we understand something if it makes sense, but research on decision making shows that this can easily lead to faulty conclusions because our memories fail us. We tend to notice certain things and ignore others, and the specific manner in which information is framed can affect the choices we make. Therefore, it is important to rule out alternative explanations one by one rather than to assume we know about human behavior just because we are humans! Go ahead and take the following quiz and see how many of the 10 questions you get right. If you miss a few, you will see that OB isn’t just common sense. If you get them all right, you are way ahead of the game!</p>
