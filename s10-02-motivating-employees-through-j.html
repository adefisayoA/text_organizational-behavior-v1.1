        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s01_p01">Many of us assume the most important motivator at work is pay. Yet, studies point to a different factor as the major influence over worker motivation—job design. How a job is designed has a major impact on employee motivation, job satisfaction, commitment to an organization, absenteeism, and turnover.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s01_p02">The question of how to properly design jobs so that employees are more productive and more satisfied has received attention from managers and researchers since the beginning of the 20th century. We will review major approaches to job design starting from its early history.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Scientific Management and Job Specialization</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s02_p01">Perhaps the earliest attempt to design jobs came during the era of scientific management. Scientific management is a philosophy based on the ideas of Frederick Taylor as presented in his 1911 book, <em class="emphasis">Principles of Scientific Management</em>. Taylor’s book is among the most influential books of the 20th century; the ideas presented had a major influence over how work was organized in the following years. Taylor was a mechanical engineer in the manufacturing industry. He saw work being done haphazardly, with only workers in charge. He saw the inefficiencies inherent in employees’ production methods and argued that a manager’s job was to carefully plan the work to be performed by employees. He also believed that scientific methods could be used to increase productivity. As an example, Taylor found that instead of allowing workers to use their own shovels, as was the custom at the time, providing specially designed shovels increased productivity. Further, by providing training and specific instructions, he was able to dramatically reduce the number of laborers required to handle each job.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_001">Taylor, F. W. (1911). Principles of scientific management. <em class="emphasis">American Magazine</em>, <em class="emphasis">71</em>, 570–581. Wilson, F. M. (1999). Rationalization and rationality 1: From the founding fathers to eugenics. <em class="emphasis">Organizational Behaviour: A Critical Introduction</em>. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s02_p02">Scientific management proposed a number of ideas that have been influential in job design in the following years. An important idea was to minimize waste by identifying the most efficient method to perform the job. Using time–motion studies, management could determine how much time each task would require and plan the tasks so that the job could be performed as efficiently as possible. Therefore, standardized job performance methods were an important element of scientific management techniques. Each job would be carefully planned in advance, and employees would be paid to perform the tasks in the way specified by management.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s02_p03">Furthermore, job specialization was one of the major advances of this approach. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Job specialization</a><span class="glossdef">Breaking down tasks to their simplest components and assigning them to employees so that each person would perform few tasks in a repetitive manner.</span></span> entails breaking down jobs into their simplest components and assigning them to employees so that each person would perform a select number of tasks in a repetitive manner. There are a number of advantages to job specialization. Breaking tasks into simple components and making them repetitive reduces the skill requirements of the jobs and decreases the effort and cost of staffing. Training times for simple, repetitive jobs tend to be shorter as well. On the other hand, from a motivational perspective, these jobs are boring and repetitive and therefore associated with negative outcomes such as absenteeism.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_002">Campion, M. A., &amp; Thayer, P. W. (1987). Job design: Approaches, outcomes, and trade-offs. <em class="emphasis">Organizational Dynamics</em>, <em class="emphasis">15</em>, 66–78.</span> Also, job specialization is ineffective in rapidly changing environments where employees may need to modify their approach according to the demands of the situation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_003">Wilson, F. M. (1999). Rationalization and rationality 1: From the founding fathers to eugenics. <em class="emphasis">Organizational Behaviour: A Critical Introduction</em>. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s02_p04">Today, Taylorism has a bad reputation, and it is often referred to as the “dark ages” of management when employees’ social motives were ignored. Yet, it is important to recognize the fundamental change in management mentality brought about by Taylor’s ideas. For the first time, managers realized their role in influencing the output levels of employees. The concept of scientific management has had a lasting impact on how work is organized. Taylor’s work paved the way to automation and standardization that is virtually universal in today’s workplace. Assembly lines where each worker performs simple tasks in a repetitive manner are a direct result of job specialization efforts. Job specialization eventually found its way to the service industry as well. One of the biggest innovations of the famous McDonald brothers’ first fast-food restaurant was the application of scientific management principles to their operations. They divided up the tasks so that one person took the orders while someone else made the burgers, another person applied the condiments, and yet another wrapped them. With this level of efficiency, customers generally received their order within 1 minute.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_004">Spake, A. (2001).

        <h2 class="title editable block">Rotation, Job Enlargement, and Enrichment</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s03_p01">One of the early alternatives to job specialization was job rotation. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Job rotation</a><span class="glossdef">Moving employees from job to job at regular intervals.</span></span> involves moving employees from job to job at regular intervals. When employees periodically move to different jobs, the monotonous aspects of job specialization can be relieved. For example, Maids International Inc., a company that provides cleaning services to households and businesses, utilizes job rotation so that maids cleaning the kitchen in one house would clean the bedroom in a different one.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_005">Denton, D. K. (1994). …I hate this job. <em class="emphasis">Business Horizons</em>, <em class="emphasis">37</em>, 46–52.</span> Using this technique, among others, the company is able to reduce its turnover level. In a supermarket study, cashiers were rotated to work in different departments. As a result of the rotation, employees’ stress levels were reduced, as measured by their blood pressure. Moreover, they experienced less pain in their neck and shoulders.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_006">Rissen, D., Melin, B., Sandsjo, L., Dohns, I., &amp; Lundberg, U. (2002). Psychophysiological stress reactions, trapezius muscle activity, and neck and shoulder pain among female cashiers before and after introduction of job rotation. <em class="emphasis">Work &amp; Stress</em>, <em class="emphasis">16</em>, 127–137.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s03_p02">Job rotation has a number of advantages for organizations. It is an effective way for employees to acquire new skills and in turn for organizations to increase the overall skill level of their employees.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_007">Campion, M. A., Cheraskin, L., &amp; Stevens, M. J. (1994). Career-related antecedents and outcomes of job rotation. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal</em>, <em class="emphasis">37</em>, 1518–1542.</span> When workers move to different positions, they are cross-trained to perform different tasks, thereby increasing the flexibility of managers to assign employees to different parts of the organization when needed. In addition, job rotation is a way to transfer knowledge between departments.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_008">Kane, A. A., Argote, L., &amp; Levine, J. M. (2005). Knowledge transfer between groups via personnel rotation: Effects of social identity and knowledge quality. <em class="emphasis">Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes</em>, <em class="emphasis">96</em>, 56–71.</span> Rotation may also have the benefit of reducing employee boredom, depending on the nature of the jobs the employee is performing at a given time. From the employee standpoint, rotation is a benefit, because they acquire new skills that keep them marketable in the long run.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s03_p03">Is rotation used only at lower levels of an organization? Anecdotal evidence suggests that companies successfully rotate high-level employees to train managers and increase innovation in the company. For example, Nokia uses rotation at all levels, such as assigning lawyers to act as country managers or moving network engineers to handset design. This approach is thought to bring a fresh perspective to old problems.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_009">Wylie, I. (2003, May). Calling for a renewable future. <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, <em class="emphasis">70</em>, 46–48.</span> Wipro Ltd., India’s information technology giant that employs about 80,000 workers, uses a 3-year plan to groom future leaders of the company by rotating them through different jobs.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_010">Ramamurti, R.

By giving employees several different tasks to be performed, as opposed to limiting their activities to a small number of tasks, organizations hope to reduce boredom and monotony as well as utilize human resources more effectively. Job enlargement may have similar benefits to job rotation, because it may also involve teaching employees multiple tasks. Research indicates that when jobs are enlarged, employees view themselves as being capable of performing a broader set of tasks.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_011">Parker, S. K. (1998). Enhancing role breadth self-efficacy: The roles of job enrichment and other organizational interventions. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">83</em>, 835–852.</span> There is some evidence that job enlargement is beneficial, because it is positively related to employee satisfaction and higher quality customer services, and it increases the chances of catching mistakes.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_012">Campion, M. A., &amp; McClelland, C. L. (1991). Interdisciplinary examination of the costs and benefits of enlarged jobs: A job design quasi-experiment. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">76</em>, 186–198.</span> At the same time, the effects of job enlargement may depend on the <em class="emphasis">type</em> of enlargement. For example, job enlargement consisting of adding tasks that are very simple in nature had negative consequences on employee satisfaction with the job and resulted in fewer errors being caught. Alternatively, giving employees more tasks that require them to be knowledgeable in different areas seemed to have more positive effects.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_013">Campion, M.

On the other hand, an instructor who is free to choose the textbook, design the course content, and use any relevant materials when delivering lectures has higher levels of autonomy. Autonomy increases motivation at work, but it also has other benefits. Giving employees autonomy at work is a key to individual as well as company success, because autonomous employees are free to choose how to do their jobs and therefore can be more effective. They are also less likely to adopt a “this is not my job” approach to their work environment and instead be proactive (do what needs to be done without waiting to be told what to do) and creative.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_019">Morgeson, F.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s04_p07">The relationship between feedback and job performance is more controversial.

Hackman and Oldham’s model proposes that the five characteristics will not have uniform effects. Instead, they proposed the following formula to calculate the motivating potential of a given job:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_025">Based on Hackman, J. R., &amp; Oldham, G. R. (1975).

                        <span class="mathphrase">
			<strong class="emphasis bold">MPS = ((Skill Variety + Task Identity + Task Significance) ÷ 3) × Autonomy × Feedback</strong>
                        </span>
		</div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s04_p10">According to this formula, autonomy and feedback are the more important elements in deciding motivating potential compared to skill variety, task identity, or task significance. Moreover, note how the job characteristics interact with each other in this model. If someone’s job is completely lacking in autonomy (or feedback), regardless of levels of variety, identity, and significance, the motivating potential score will be very low.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s04_p11">Note that the five job characteristics are not objective features of a job. Two employees working in the same job may have very different perceptions regarding how much skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, or feedback the job affords. In other words, motivating potential is in the eye of the beholder. This is both good and bad news. The bad news is that even though a manager may design a job that is supposed to motivate employees, some employees may not find the job to be motivational. The good news is that sometimes it is possible to increase employee motivation by helping employees change their perspective about the job. For example, employees laying bricks at a construction site may feel their jobs are low in significance, but by pointing out that they are building a home for others, their perceptions about their job may be changed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s04_p12">Do all employees expect to have a job that has a high motivating potential? Research has shown that the desire for the five core job characteristics is not universal. One factor that affects how much of these characteristics people want or need is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">growth need strength</a><span class="glossdef">The degree to which a person has higher order needs, such as self-esteem and self-actualization.</span></span>. Growth need strength describes the degree to which a person has higher order needs, such as self-esteem and self-actualization. When an employee’s expectation from his job includes such higher order needs, employees will have high-growth need strength, whereas those who expect their job to pay the bills and satisfy more basic needs will have low-growth need strength. Not surprisingly, research shows that those with high-growth need strength respond more favorably to jobs with a high motivating potential.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_026">Arnold, H.

<em class="emphasis">If you are not receiving enough feedback on the job, it is better to seek it instead of trying to guess how you are doing</em>. Consider seeking regular feedback from your boss. This also has the added benefit of signaling to the manager that you care about your performance and want to be successful.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be genuine in your desire to learn</em>. When seeking feedback, your aim should be improving yourself as opposed to creating the impression that you are a motivated employee. If your manager thinks that you are managing impressions rather than genuinely trying to improve your performance, seeking feedback may hurt you.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Develop a good relationship with your manager</em>. This has the benefit of giving you more feedback in the first place. It also has the upside of making it easier to ask direct questions about your own performance.</li>

<em class="emphasis">Consider finding trustworthy peers who can share information with you regarding your performance</em>. Your manager is not the only helpful source of feedback.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be gracious when you receive feedback</em>. If you automatically go on the defensive the first time you receive negative feedback, there may not be a next time. Remember, even if receiving feedback, positive or negative, feels uncomfortable, it is a gift. You can improve your performance using feedback, and people giving negative feedback probably feel they are risking your good will by being honest. Be thankful and appreciative when you receive any feedback and do not try to convince the person that it is inaccurate (unless there are factual mistakes).</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s05_p01">One of the contemporary approaches to motivating employees through job design is empowerment. The concept of empowerment extends the idea of autonomy. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Empowerment</a><span class="glossdef">The removal of conditions that make a person powerless.</span></span> may be defined as the removal of conditions that make a person powerless.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_028">Conger, J. A., &amp; Kanungo, R. N. (1988). The empowerment process: Integrating theory and practice. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Review</em>, <em class="emphasis">13</em>, 471–482.</span> The idea behind empowerment is that employees have the ability to make decisions and perform their jobs effectively if management removes certain barriers. Thus, instead of dictating roles, companies should create an environment where employees thrive, feel motivated, and have discretion to make decisions about the content and context of their jobs. Employees who feel empowered believe that their work is meaningful. They tend to feel that they are capable of performing their jobs effectively, have the ability to influence how the company operates, and can perform their jobs in any way they see fit, without close supervision and other interference. These liberties enable employees to feel powerful.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_029">Spreitzer, G. M. (1995). Psychological empowerment in the workplace: Dimensions, measurement, and validation. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal</em>, <em class="emphasis">38</em>, 1442–1465; Thomas, K. W., &amp; Velthouse, B. A. (1990). Cognitive elements of empowerment: An “interpretive” model of intrinsic task motivation. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Review</em>, <em class="emphasis">15</em>, 666–681.</span> In cases of very high levels of empowerment, employees decide what tasks to perform and how to perform them, in a sense managing themselves.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s05_p02">Research has distinguished between <em class="emphasis">structural</em> elements of empowerment and <em class="emphasis">felt</em> empowerment. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Structural empowerment</a><span class="glossdef">The aspects of the work environment that give employees discretion and autonomy, and enable them to do their jobs effectively.</span></span> refers to the aspects of the work environment that give employees discretion, autonomy, and the ability to do their jobs effectively. The idea is that the presence of certain structural factors helps empower people, but in the end empowerment is a perception. The following figure demonstrates the relationship between structural and felt empowerment. For example, at Harley-Davidson Motor Company, employees have the authority to stop the production line if they see a blemish on the product.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_030">Lustgarten, A. (2004). Harley-Davidson. <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>, <em class="emphasis">149</em>(1), 76.</span> Leadership style is another influence over experienced empowerment.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_031">Kark, R., Shamir, B., &amp; Chen, G. (2003). The two faces of transformational leadership: Empowerment and dependency. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">88</em>, 246–255.</span> If the manager is controlling, micromanaging, and bossy, chances are that empowerment will not be possible. A company’s structure has a role in determining empowerment as well. Factories organized around teams, such as the Saturn plant of General Motors Corporation, can still empower employees, despite the presence of a traditional hierarchy.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_032">Ford. R. C., &amp; Fottler, M. D. (1995). Empowerment: A matter of degree. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Executive</em>, <em class="emphasis">9</em>, 21–29.</span> Access to information is often mentioned as a key factor in empowering employees. If employees are not given information to make an informed decision, empowerment attempts will fail. Therefore, the relationship between access to information and empowerment is well established. Finally, empowering individual employees cannot occur in a bubble, but instead depends on creating a climate of empowerment throughout the entire organization.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_033">Seibert, S.

Those individuals with low growth strength or low achievement need may not benefit as strongly from empowerment. Moreover, the idea of empowerment is not always easy to implement, because some managers may feel threatened when subordinates are empowered. If employees do not feel ready for empowerment, they may also worry about the increased responsibility and accountability. Therefore, preparing employees for empowerment by carefully selecting and training them is important to the success of empowerment interventions.</p>

Job specialization is efficient but leads to boredom and monotony. Early alternatives to job specialization include job rotation, job enlargement, and job enrichment. Research shows that there are five job components that increase the motivating potential of a job: Skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback. Finally, empowerment is a contemporary way of motivating employees through job design. These approaches increase worker motivation and have the potential to increase performance.</p>
