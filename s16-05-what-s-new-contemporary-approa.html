        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s01_p03">While transformational leaders rely on their charisma, persuasiveness, and personal appeal to change and inspire their companies, transactional leaders use three different methods. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Contingent rewards</a><span class="glossdef">Rewarding employees for their accomplishments.</span></span> mean rewarding employees for their accomplishments. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Active management by exception</a><span class="glossdef">Leaving employees alone but at the same time proactively predicting potential problems and preventing them from occurring.</span></span> involves leaving employees to do their jobs without interference, but at the same time proactively predicting potential problems and preventing them from occurring. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Passive management by exception</a><span class="glossdef">Leaving employees alone but then coming to the rescue if anything goes wrong.</span></span> is similar in that it involves leaving employees alone, but in this method the manager waits until something goes wrong before coming to the rescue.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s01_p04">Which leadership style do you think is more effective, transformational or transactional?

They should also monitor themselves to avoid demonstrating passive management by exception, or leaving employees to their own devices until problems arise.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s01_p05">Why is transformational leadership effective? The key factor may be <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trust</a><span class="glossdef">The belief that the other party will show integrity, fairness, and predictability in one’s actions toward the other.</span></span>. Trust is the belief that the leader will show integrity, fairness, and predictability in his or her dealings with others. Research shows that when leaders demonstrate transformational leadership behaviors, followers are more likely to trust the leader. The tendency to trust in transactional leaders is substantially lower. Because transformational leaders express greater levels of concern for people’s well-being and appeal to people’s values, followers are more likely to believe that the leader has a trustworthy character.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_045">Dirks, K.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s01_p06">Is transformational leadership genetic? Some people assume that charisma is something people are born with. You either have charisma, or you don’t. However, research does not support this idea. We must acknowledge that there is a connection between some personality traits and charisma. Specifically, people who have a neurotic personality tend to demonstrate lower levels of charisma, and people who are extraverted tend to have higher levels of charisma. However, personality explains only around 10% of the variance in charisma.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_046">Bono, J. E., &amp; Judge, T. A. (2004).

            <p class="para">Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish Republic and its first president, is known as a charismatic leader. He is widely admired and respected in Turkey and around the world. His picture appears in all schools, state buildings, all denominations of Turkish lira, and in many people’s homes in Turkey.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s01_p07">Even if charisma can be learned, a more fundamental question remains: Is it really needed? Charisma is only one element of transformational leadership, and leaders can be effective without charisma. In fact, charisma has a dark side. For every charismatic hero such as Lee Iaccoca, Steve Jobs, and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.’s Sir Richard Branson, there are charismatic personalities who harmed their organizations or nations, such as Adoph Hitler of Germany and Jeff Skilling of Enron Corporation. Leadership experts warn that when organizations are in a crisis, a board of directors or hiring manager may turn to heroes who they hope will save the organization, and sometimes hire people who have no particular qualifications other than being perceived as charismatic.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_048">Khurana, R. (2002, September). The curse of the superstar CEO. <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em>, <em class="emphasis">80</em>(9), 60–66.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s01_p08">An interesting study shows that when companies have performed well, their CEOs are perceived as charismatic, but CEO charisma has no relation to the future performance of a company.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_049">Agle, B. R., Nagarajan, N. J., Sonnenfeld, J. A., &amp; Srinivasan, D. (2006). Does CEO charisma matter? An empirical analysis of the relationships among organizational performance, environmental uncertainty, and top management team perceptions of CEO charisma. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal</em>, <em class="emphasis">49</em>, 161–174.</span> So, what we view as someone’s charisma may be largely because of their association with a successful company, and the success of a company depends on a large set of factors, including industry effects and historical performance. While it is true that charismatic leaders may sometimes achieve great results, the search for charismatic leaders under all circumstances may be irrational.</p>

If you have ever been in a high LMX relationship with your manager, you may attest to the advantages of the relationship.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s02_p14">Should you worry if you do not have a high-quality relationship with your manager? One problem in a low-quality exchange is that employees may not have access to the positive work environment available to high LMX members. Secondly, low LMX employees may feel that their situation is unfair. Even when their objective performance does not warrant it, those who have a good relationship with the leader tend to have positive performance appraisals.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_061">Duarte, N. T., Goodson, J. R., &amp; Klich, N. R. (1994). Effects of dyadic quality and duration on performance appraisal. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal</em>, <em class="emphasis">37</em>, 499–521.</span> Moreover, they are more likely to be given the benefit of the doubt. For example, when high LMX employees succeed, the manager is more likely to think that they succeeded because they put forth a lot of effort and had high abilities, whereas for low LMX members who perform objectively well, the manager is less likely to make the same attribution.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_062">Heneman, R. L., Greenberger, D. B., &amp; Anonyuo, C. (1989). Attributions and exchanges: The effects of interpersonal factors on the diagnosis of employee performance. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal</em>, <em class="emphasis">32</em>, 466–476.</span> In other words, the leader may interpret the same situation differently, depending on which employee is involved, and may reward low LMX employees less despite equivalent performance. In short, those with a low-quality relationship with their leader may experience a work environment that may not be supportive or fair.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s02_p15">Despite its negative consequences, we cannot say that all employees want to have a high-quality relationship with their leader. Some employees may genuinely dislike the leader and may not value the rewards in the leader’s possession. If the leader is not well liked in the company and is known as abusive or unethical, being close to such a person may imply guilt by association. For employees who have no interest in advancing their careers in the current company (such as a student employee who is working in retail but has no interest in retail as a career), having a low-quality exchange may afford the opportunity to just do one’s job without having to go above and beyond the job requirements. Finally, not all leaders are equally capable of influencing their employees by having a good relationship with them: It also depends on the power and influence of the leader in the company as a whole and how the leader is treated within the organization. Leaders who are more powerful will have more to share with their employees.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_063">Erdogan, B., &amp; Enders, J. (2007). Support from the top: Supervisors’ perceived organizational support as a moderator of leader-member exchange to satisfaction and performance relationships. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">92</em>, 321–330; Sparrowe, R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s02_p16">What LMX theory implies for leaders is that one way of influencing employees is through the types of relationships leaders form with their subordinates. These relationships develop naturally through the work-related and personal interactions between the manager and the employee. Because they occur naturally, some leaders may not be aware of the power that lies in them. These relationships have an important influence over employee attitudes and behaviors. In the worst case, they have the potential to create an environment characterized by favoritism and unfairness. Therefore, managers are advised to be aware of how they build these relationships: Put forth effort in cultivating these relationships consciously, be open to forming good relationships with people from all backgrounds regardless of characteristics such as sex, race, age, or disability status, and prevent these relationships from leading to an unfair work environment.</p>

Here are some tips to developing a high-quality exchange.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s02_l01">
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Create interaction opportunities with your manager</em>. One way of doing this would be seeking feedback from your manager with the intention of improving your performance. Be careful though: If the manager believes that you are seeking feedback for a different purpose, it will not help.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">People are more attracted to those who are similar to them</em>. So find out where your similarities lie. What does your manager like that you also like? Do you have similar working styles? Do you have any mutual experiences? Bringing up your commonalities in conversations may help.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Utilize impression management tactics, but be tactful</em>. If there are work-related areas in which you can sincerely compliment your manager, do so. For example, if your manager made a decision that you agree with, you may share your support. Most people, including managers, appreciate positive feedback. However, flattering your manager in non-work-related areas (such as appearance) or using flattery in an insincere way (praising an action you do not agree with) will only backfire and cause you to be labeled as a flatterer.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be a reliable employee</em>. Managers need people they can trust. By performing at a high level, demonstrating predictable and consistent behavior, and by volunteering for challenging assignments, you can prove your worth.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be aware that relationships develop early</em> (as early as the first week of your working together). So be careful how you behave during the interview and your very first days. If you rub your manager the wrong way early on, it will be harder to recover the relationship.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s03_p01">The early 21st century has been marked by a series of highly publicized corporate ethics scandals: Between 2000 and 2003 we witnessed the scandals of Enron, WorldCom, Arthur Andersen LLP, Qwest Communications International Inc., and Global Crossing Ltd. As corporate ethics scandals shake investor confidence in corporations and leaders, the importance of ethical leadership and keeping long-term interests of stakeholders in mind is becoming more widely acknowledged.</p>

According to this approach, the primary mission of the leader is to develop employees and help them reach their goals. Servant leaders put their employees first, understand their personal needs and desires, empower them, and help them develop in their careers. Unlike mainstream management approaches, the overriding objective in servant leadership is not limited to getting employees to contribute to organizational goals. Instead, servant leaders feel an obligation to their employees, customers, and the external community. Employee happiness is seen as an end in itself, and servant leaders sometimes sacrifice their own well-being to help employees succeed. In addition to a clear focus on having a moral compass, servant leaders are also interested in serving the community. In other words, their efforts to help others are not restricted to company insiders, and they are genuinely concerned about the broader community surrounding their organization.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_064">Greenleaf, R.

Research shows that servant leadership has a positive impact on employee commitment, employee citizenship behaviors toward the community (such as participating in community volunteering), and job performance.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_066">Liden, R.

In fact, many of today’s corporate leaders are not known for their humility! However, leaders who have adopted this approach attest to its effectiveness. David Wolfskehl, of Action Fast Print in New Jersey, founded his printing company when he was 24 years old. He marks the day he started asking employees what he can do for them as the beginning of his company’s new culture. In the next 2 years, his company increased its productivity by 30%.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_068">Buchanan, L. (2007, May).

            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s03_p05">One of the influential leadership paradigms involves leaders putting others first. This could be a hard transition for an achievement-oriented and success-driven manager who rises to high levels. Here are some tips to achieve servant leadership.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s03_l01">
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Don’t ask what your employees can do for you</em>. Think of what you can do for them. Your job as a leader is to be of service to them. How can you relieve their stress? Protect them from undue pressure? Pitch in to help them? Think about creative ways of helping ease their lives.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">One of your key priorities should be to help employees reach their goals</em>. This involves getting to know them. Learn about who they are and what their values and priorities are.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be humble</em>. You are not supposed to have all the answers and dictate others. One way of achieving this humbleness may be to do volunteer work.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be open with your employees</em>. Ask them questions. Give them information so that they understand what is going on in the company.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Find ways of helping the external community</em>. Giving employees opportunities to be involved in community volunteer projects or even thinking and strategizing about making a positive impact on the greater community would help.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s04_p01">Leaders have to be a lot of things to a lot of people. They operate within different structures, work with different types of people, and they have to be adaptable. At times, it may seem that a leader’s smartest strategy would be to act as a social chameleon, changing his or her style whenever doing so seems advantageous. But this would lose sight of the fact that effective leaders have to stay true to themselves. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">authentic leadership approach</a><span class="glossdef">A leadership approach advising leaders to stay true to their own values.</span></span> embraces this value: Its key advice is “be yourself.” Think about it: We all have different backgrounds, different life experiences, and different role models. These trigger events over the course of our lifetime that shape our values, preferences, and priorities. Instead of trying to fit into societal expectations about what a leader should be, act like, or look like, authentic leaders derive their strength from their own past experiences. Thus, one key characteristic of authentic leaders is that they are self aware. They are introspective, understand where they are coming from, and have a thorough understanding of their own values and priorities. Secondly, they are not afraid to act the way they are. In other words, they have high levels of personal integrity. They say what they think. They behave in a way consistent with their values. As a result, they remain true to themselves. Instead of trying to imitate other great leaders, they find their own style in their personality and life experiences.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_069">Avolio, B. J., &amp; Gardner, W.

As a child, Schultz witnessed the job-related difficulties his father experienced as a result of medical problems. Even though he had no idea he would have his own business one day, the desire to protect people was shaped in those years and became one of his foremost values.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s04_p03">Authentic leadership requires understanding oneself. Therefore, in addition to self reflection, feedback from others is needed to gain a true understanding of one’s behavior and its impact on others. Authentic leadership is viewed as a potentially influential style, because employees are more likely to trust such a leader. Moreover, working for an authentic leader is likely to lead to greater levels of satisfaction, performance, and overall well-being on the part of employees.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn12_071">Walumbwa, F.

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch12_s04_s04_p04">Contemporary approaches to leadership include transformational leadership, leader-member exchange, servant leadership, and authentic leadership. The transformational leadership approach highlights the importance of leader charisma, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration as methods of influence. Its counterpart is the transactional leadership approach, in which the leader focuses on getting employees to achieve organizational goals. According to the leader-member exchange (LMX) approach, the unique, trust-based relationships leaders develop with employees are the key to leadership effectiveness. Recently, leadership scholars started to emphasize the importance of serving others and adopting a customer-oriented view of leadership; another recent focus is on the importance of being true to oneself as a leader. While each leadership approach focuses on a different element of leadership, effective leaders will need to change their style based on the demands of the situation, as well as utilizing their own values and moral compass.</p>
