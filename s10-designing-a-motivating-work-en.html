    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_p06">What are the tools companies can use to ensure a motivated workforce? Nucor seems to have found two very useful tools to motivate its workforce: a job design incorporating empowerment, and a reward system that aligns company performance with employee rewards. In this chapter, we will cover the basic tools organizations can use to motivate workers. The tools that will be described are based on motivation principles such as expectancy theory, reinforcement theory, and need-based theories. Specifically, we cover motivating employees through job design, goal setting, performance feedback, and reward systems.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">6.1</span> Motivating Steel Workers Works: The Case of Nucor</h2>
    <div class="callout block" id="fwk-122425-ch06a_s01_n01">

        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch06a_s01_p01">Manufacturing steel is not a glamorous job. The industry is beset by many problems, and more than 40 steel manufacturers have filed for bankruptcy in recent years. Most young employees do not view working at a steel mill as their dream job. Yet, one company distinguished itself from all the rest by remaining profitable for over 130 quarters and by providing an over 350% return on investment (ROI) to shareholders. The company is clearly doing well by every financial metric available and is the most profitable in its industry.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch06a_s01_p02">How do they achieve these amazing results? For one thing, every one of Nucor Corporation’s (NYSE: NUE) 12,000 employees acts like an owner of the company. Employees are encouraged to fix the things they see as wrong and have real power on their jobs. When there is a breakdown in a plant, a supervisor does not have to ask employees to work overtime; employees volunteer for it. In fact, the company is famous for its decentralized structure and for pushing authority and responsibility down to lower levels in the hierarchy. Tasks that previously belonged to management are performed by line workers. Management listens to lower level employees and routinely implements their new ideas.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch06a_s01_p03">The reward system in place at Nucor is also unique, and its employees may be the highest paid steelworkers in the world. In 2005, the average Nucor employee earned $79,000, followed by a $2,000 bonus decided by the company’s annual earnings and $18,000 in the form of profit sharing. At the same time, a large percentage of these earnings are based on performance. People have the opportunity to earn a lot of money if the company is doing well, and there is no upward limit to how much they can make. However, they will do much worse than their counterparts in other mills if the company does poorly. Thus, it is to everyone’s advantage to help the company perform well. The same incentive system exists at all levels of the company. CEO pay is clearly tied to corporate performance. The incentive system penalizes low performers while increasing commitment to the company as well as to high performance.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch06a_s01_p04">Nucor’s formula for success seems simple: align company goals with employee goals and give employees real power to make things happen. The results seem to work for the company and its employees. Evidence of this successful method is that the company has one of the lowest employee turnover rates in the industry and remains one of the few remaining nonunionized environments in manufacturing. Nucor is the largest U.S. minimill and steel scrap recycler.</p>

How a job is designed has a major impact on employee motivation, job satisfaction, commitment to an organization, absenteeism, and turnover.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Scientific Management and Job Specialization</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s02_p01">Perhaps the earliest attempt to design jobs came during the era of scientific management. Scientific management is a philosophy based on the ideas of Frederick Taylor as presented in his 1911 book, <em class="emphasis">Principles of Scientific Management</em>. Taylor’s book is among the most influential books of the 20th century; the ideas presented had a major influence over how work was organized in the following years. Taylor was a mechanical engineer in the manufacturing industry. He saw work being done haphazardly, with only workers in charge. He saw the inefficiencies inherent in employees’ production methods and argued that a manager’s job was to carefully plan the work to be performed by employees. He also believed that scientific methods could be used to increase productivity. As an example, Taylor found that instead of allowing workers to use their own shovels, as was the custom at the time, providing specially designed shovels increased productivity. Further, by providing training and specific instructions, he was able to dramatically reduce the number of laborers required to handle each job.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_001">Taylor, F. W. (1911). Principles of scientific management. <em class="emphasis">American Magazine</em>, <em class="emphasis">71</em>, 570–581. Wilson, F. M. (1999). Rationalization and rationality 1: From the founding fathers to eugenics. <em class="emphasis">Organizational Behaviour: A Critical Introduction</em>. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s02_p02">Scientific management proposed a number of ideas that have been influential in job design in the following years. An important idea was to minimize waste by identifying the most efficient method to perform the job. Using time–motion studies, management could determine how much time each task would require and plan the tasks so that the job could be performed as efficiently as possible. Therefore, standardized job performance methods were an important element of scientific management techniques. Each job would be carefully planned in advance, and employees would be paid to perform the tasks in the way specified by management.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s02_p03">Furthermore, job specialization was one of the major advances of this approach. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Job specialization</a><span class="glossdef">Breaking down tasks to their simplest components and assigning them to employees so that each person would perform few tasks in a repetitive manner.</span></span> entails breaking down jobs into their simplest components and assigning them to employees so that each person would perform a select number of tasks in a repetitive manner. There are a number of advantages to job specialization. Breaking tasks into simple components and making them repetitive reduces the skill requirements of the jobs and decreases the effort and cost of staffing. Training times for simple, repetitive jobs tend to be shorter as well. On the other hand, from a motivational perspective, these jobs are boring and repetitive and therefore associated with negative outcomes such as absenteeism.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_002">Campion, M. A., &amp; Thayer, P. W. (1987). Job design: Approaches, outcomes, and trade-offs. <em class="emphasis">Organizational Dynamics</em>, <em class="emphasis">15</em>, 66–78.</span> Also, job specialization is ineffective in rapidly changing environments where employees may need to modify their approach according to the demands of the situation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_003">Wilson, F. M. (1999). Rationalization and rationality 1: From the founding fathers to eugenics. <em class="emphasis">Organizational Behaviour: A Critical Introduction</em>. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s02_p04">Today, Taylorism has a bad reputation, and it is often referred to as the “dark ages” of management when employees’ social motives were ignored. Yet, it is important to recognize the fundamental change in management mentality brought about by Taylor’s ideas. For the first time, managers realized their role in influencing the output levels of employees. The concept of scientific management has had a lasting impact on how work is organized. Taylor’s work paved the way to automation and standardization that is virtually universal in today’s workplace. Assembly lines where each worker performs simple tasks in a repetitive manner are a direct result of job specialization efforts. Job specialization eventually found its way to the service industry as well. One of the biggest innovations of the famous McDonald brothers’ first fast-food restaurant was the application of scientific management principles to their operations. They divided up the tasks so that one person took the orders while someone else made the burgers, another person applied the condiments, and yet another wrapped them. With this level of efficiency, customers generally received their order within 1 minute.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_004">Spake, A. (2001).

        <h2 class="title editable block">Rotation, Job Enlargement, and Enrichment</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s03_p01">One of the early alternatives to job specialization was job rotation. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Job rotation</a><span class="glossdef">Moving employees from job to job at regular intervals.</span></span> involves moving employees from job to job at regular intervals. When employees periodically move to different jobs, the monotonous aspects of job specialization can be relieved. For example, Maids International Inc., a company that provides cleaning services to households and businesses, utilizes job rotation so that maids cleaning the kitchen in one house would clean the bedroom in a different one.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_005">Denton, D. K. (1994). …I hate this job. <em class="emphasis">Business Horizons</em>, <em class="emphasis">37</em>, 46–52.</span> Using this technique, among others, the company is able to reduce its turnover level. In a supermarket study, cashiers were rotated to work in different departments. As a result of the rotation, employees’ stress levels were reduced, as measured by their blood pressure. Moreover, they experienced less pain in their neck and shoulders.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_006">Rissen, D., Melin, B., Sandsjo, L., Dohns, I., &amp; Lundberg, U. (2002). Psychophysiological stress reactions, trapezius muscle activity, and neck and shoulder pain among female cashiers before and after introduction of job rotation. <em class="emphasis">Work &amp; Stress</em>, <em class="emphasis">16</em>, 127–137.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s03_p02">Job rotation has a number of advantages for organizations. It is an effective way for employees to acquire new skills and in turn for organizations to increase the overall skill level of their employees.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_007">Campion, M. A., Cheraskin, L., &amp; Stevens, M. J. (1994). Career-related antecedents and outcomes of job rotation. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal</em>, <em class="emphasis">37</em>, 1518–1542.</span> When workers move to different positions, they are cross-trained to perform different tasks, thereby increasing the flexibility of managers to assign employees to different parts of the organization when needed. In addition, job rotation is a way to transfer knowledge between departments.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_008">Kane, A. A., Argote, L., &amp; Levine, J. M. (2005). Knowledge transfer between groups via personnel rotation: Effects of social identity and knowledge quality. <em class="emphasis">Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes</em>, <em class="emphasis">96</em>, 56–71.</span> Rotation may also have the benefit of reducing employee boredom, depending on the nature of the jobs the employee is performing at a given time. From the employee standpoint, rotation is a benefit, because they acquire new skills that keep them marketable in the long run.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s03_p03">Is rotation used only at lower levels of an organization? Anecdotal evidence suggests that companies successfully rotate high-level employees to train managers and increase innovation in the company. For example, Nokia uses rotation at all levels, such as assigning lawyers to act as country managers or moving network engineers to handset design. This approach is thought to bring a fresh perspective to old problems.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_009">Wylie, I. (2003, May).

By giving employees several different tasks to be performed, as opposed to limiting their activities to a small number of tasks, organizations hope to reduce boredom and monotony as well as utilize human resources more effectively. Job enlargement may have similar benefits to job rotation, because it may also involve teaching employees multiple tasks. Research indicates that when jobs are enlarged, employees view themselves as being capable of performing a broader set of tasks.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_011">Parker, S. K. (1998). Enhancing role breadth self-efficacy: The roles of job enrichment and other organizational interventions. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">83</em>, 835–852.</span> There is some evidence that job enlargement is beneficial, because it is positively related to employee satisfaction and higher quality customer services, and it increases the chances of catching mistakes.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_012">Campion, M. A., &amp; McClelland, C. L. (1991). Interdisciplinary examination of the costs and benefits of enlarged jobs: A job design quasi-experiment. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">76</em>, 186–198.</span> At the same time, the effects of job enlargement may depend on the <em class="emphasis">type</em> of enlargement. For example, job enlargement consisting of adding tasks that are very simple in nature had negative consequences on employee satisfaction with the job and resulted in fewer errors being caught. Alternatively, giving employees more tasks that require them to be knowledgeable in different areas seemed to have more positive effects.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_013">Campion, M.

As an example, an instructor who is required to follow a predetermined textbook, covering a given list of topics using a specified list of classroom activities, has low autonomy. On the other hand, an instructor who is free to choose the textbook, design the course content, and use any relevant materials when delivering lectures has higher levels of autonomy. Autonomy increases motivation at work, but it also has other benefits. Giving employees autonomy at work is a key to individual as well as company success, because autonomous employees are free to choose how to do their jobs and therefore can be more effective. They are also less likely to adopt a “this is not my job” approach to their work environment and instead be proactive (do what needs to be done without waiting to be told what to do) and creative.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_019">Morgeson, F.

Feedback at work may come from other people, such as supervisors, peers, subordinates, and customers, or it may come from the job itself. A salesperson who gives presentations to potential clients but is not informed of the clients’ decisions, has low feedback at work. If this person receives notification that a sale was made based on the presentation, feedback will be high.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s04_p07">The relationship between feedback and job performance is more controversial. In other words, the mere presence of feedback is not sufficient for employees to feel motivated to perform better.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s04_p08">According to the job characteristics model, the presence of these five core job dimensions leads employees to experience three psychological states: They view their work as <em class="emphasis">meaningful</em>, they feel <em class="emphasis">responsible</em> for the outcomes, and they acquire <em class="emphasis">knowledge of results</em>. These three psychological states in turn are related to positive outcomes such as overall job satisfaction, internal motivation, higher performance, and lower absenteeism and turnover.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_024">Brass, D.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s04_p09">Are all five job characteristics equally valuable for employees? Hackman and Oldham’s model proposes that the five characteristics will not have uniform effects. Instead, they proposed the following formula to calculate the motivating potential of a given job:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_025">Based on Hackman, J. R., &amp; Oldham, G. R. (1975).

		</div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s04_p10">According to this formula, autonomy and feedback are the more important elements in deciding motivating potential compared to skill variety, task identity, or task significance. Moreover, note how the job characteristics interact with each other in this model. If someone’s job is completely lacking in autonomy (or feedback), regardless of levels of variety, identity, and significance, the motivating potential score will be very low.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s04_p11">Note that the five job characteristics are not objective features of a job. Two employees working in the same job may have very different perceptions regarding how much skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, or feedback the job affords. In other words, motivating potential is in the eye of the beholder. This is both good and bad news. The bad news is that even though a manager may design a job that is supposed to motivate employees, some employees may not find the job to be motivational. The good news is that sometimes it is possible to increase employee motivation by helping employees change their perspective about the job. For example, employees laying bricks at a construction site may feel their jobs are low in significance, but by pointing out that they are building a home for others, their perceptions about their job may be changed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s04_p12">Do all employees expect to have a job that has a high motivating potential? Research has shown that the desire for the five core job characteristics is not universal. One factor that affects how much of these characteristics people want or need is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">growth need strength</a><span class="glossdef">The degree to which a person has higher order needs, such as self-esteem and self-actualization.</span></span>. Growth need strength describes the degree to which a person has higher order needs, such as self-esteem and self-actualization. When an employee’s expectation from his job includes such higher order needs, employees will have high-growth need strength, whereas those who expect their job to pay the bills and satisfy more basic needs will have low-growth need strength. Not surprisingly, research shows that those with high-growth need strength respond more favorably to jobs with a high motivating potential.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_026">Arnold, H.

<em class="emphasis">If you are not receiving enough feedback on the job, it is better to seek it instead of trying to guess how you are doing</em>. Consider seeking regular feedback from your boss.

                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be genuine in your desire to learn</em>. When seeking feedback, your aim should be improving yourself as opposed to creating the impression that you are a motivated employee.

Remember, even if receiving feedback, positive or negative, feels uncomfortable, it is a gift. You can improve your performance using feedback, and people giving negative feedback probably feel they are risking your good will by being honest. Be thankful and appreciative when you receive any feedback and do not try to convince the person that it is inaccurate (unless there are factual mistakes).</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s05_p01">One of the contemporary approaches to motivating employees through job design is empowerment. The concept of empowerment extends the idea of autonomy. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Empowerment</a><span class="glossdef">The removal of conditions that make a person powerless.</span></span> may be defined as the removal of conditions that make a person powerless.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_028">Conger, J. A., &amp; Kanungo, R. N. (1988). The empowerment process: Integrating theory and practice. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Review</em>, <em class="emphasis">13</em>, 471–482.</span> The idea behind empowerment is that employees have the ability to make decisions and perform their jobs effectively if management removes certain barriers. Thus, instead of dictating roles, companies should create an environment where employees thrive, feel motivated, and have discretion to make decisions about the content and context of their jobs. Employees who feel empowered believe that their work is meaningful. They tend to feel that they are capable of performing their jobs effectively, have the ability to influence how the company operates, and can perform their jobs in any way they see fit, without close supervision and other interference. These liberties enable employees to feel powerful.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_029">Spreitzer, G. M. (1995).

Cognitive elements of empowerment: An “interpretive” model of intrinsic task motivation. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Review</em>, <em class="emphasis">15</em>, 666–681.</span> In cases of very high levels of empowerment, employees decide what tasks to perform and how to perform them, in a sense managing themselves.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s01_s05_p02">Research has distinguished between <em class="emphasis">structural</em> elements of empowerment and <em class="emphasis">felt</em> empowerment. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Structural empowerment</a><span class="glossdef">The aspects of the work environment that give employees discretion and autonomy, and enable them to do their jobs effectively.</span></span> refers to the aspects of the work environment that give employees discretion, autonomy, and the ability to do their jobs effectively. The idea is that the presence of certain structural factors helps empower people, but in the end empowerment is a perception. The following figure demonstrates the relationship between structural and felt empowerment. For example, at Harley-Davidson Motor Company, employees have the authority to stop the production line if they see a blemish on the product.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_030">Lustgarten, A.

(2003). The two faces of transformational leadership: Empowerment and dependency. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">88</em>, 246–255.</span> If the manager is controlling, micromanaging, and bossy, chances are that empowerment will not be possible. A company’s structure has a role in determining empowerment as well. Factories organized around teams, such as the Saturn plant of General Motors Corporation, can still empower employees, despite the presence of a traditional hierarchy.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_032">Ford.

If employees are not given information to make an informed decision, empowerment attempts will fail. Therefore, the relationship between access to information and empowerment is well established. Finally, empowering individual employees cannot occur in a bubble, but instead depends on creating a climate of empowerment throughout the entire organization.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_033">Seibert, S.

Those individuals with low growth strength or low achievement need may not benefit as strongly from empowerment. Moreover, the idea of empowerment is not always easy to implement, because some managers may feel threatened when subordinates are empowered. If employees do not feel ready for empowerment, they may also worry about the increased responsibility and accountability. Therefore, preparing employees for empowerment by carefully selecting and training them is important to the success of empowerment interventions.</p>

Job specialization is efficient but leads to boredom and monotony. Early alternatives to job specialization include job rotation, job enlargement, and job enrichment. Research shows that there are five job components that increase the motivating potential of a job: Skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback. Finally, empowerment is a contemporary way of motivating employees through job design. These approaches increase worker motivation and have the potential to increase performance.</p>

If goals are not specific and measurable, how would you know whether you have reached the goal? A wide distribution of performance levels could potentially be acceptable.

Moreover, some of the most important elements of someone’s performance may not be easily quantifiable (such as employee or customer satisfaction). So how do you set specific and measurable goals for these soft targets? Even though some effort will be involved, metrics such as satisfaction can and should be quantified. For example, you could design a survey for employees and customers to track satisfaction ratings from year to year.</p>

Changing the goal-setting process at Microsoft. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Executive</em>, <em class="emphasis">18</em>, 139–142.</span> First, goals give us direction. When you have a goal of reducing shipment of defective products by 5% by September, you know that you should direct your energy toward defects. The goal tells you what to focus on. For this reason, goals should be set carefully. Giving employees goals that are not aligned with company goals will be a problem, because goals will direct employees' energies to a certain end. Second, goals energize people and tell them not to stop until the goal is accomplished. If you set goals for yourself such as “I will have a break from reading this textbook when I finish reading this section,” you will not give up until you reach the end of the section. Even if you feel tired along the way, having this specific goal will urge you to move forward. Third, having a goal provides a challenge. When people have goals and proceed to reach them, they feel a sense of accomplishment. Finally, SMART goals urge people to think outside the box and rethink how they are working. If the goal is not very difficult, it only motivates people to work faster or longer. If a goal is substantially difficult, merely working faster or longer will not get you the results. Instead, you will need to rethink the way you usually work and devise a creative way of working. It has been argued that this method resulted in designers and engineers in Japan inventing the bullet train. Having a goal that went beyond the speed capabilities of traditional trains prevented engineers from making minor improvements and inspired them to come up with a radically different concept.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_046">Kerr, S., &amp; Landauer, S.

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s02_s06_p03">Goal-setting theory is one of the most influential theories of motivation. In order to motivate employees, goals should be SMART (specific, measurable, aggressive, realistic, and time-bound). SMART goals motivate employees because they energize behavior, give it direction, provide a challenge, force employees to think outside the box, and devise new and novel methods of performing. Goals are more effective in motivating employees when employees receive feedback on their accomplishments, have the ability to perform, and are committed to goals. Poorly derived goals have the downsides of hampering learning, preventing adaptability, causing a single-minded pursuit of goals at the exclusion of other activities, and encouraging unethical behavior. Companies tie individual goals to company goals using management by objectives.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Is a Performance Appraisal?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s03_s01_p01">When employees have goals, they tend to be more motivated if they also receive feedback about their progress. Feedback may occur throughout the workday, but many organizations also have a formal, companywide process of providing feedback to employees, called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">performance appraisal</a><span class="glossdef">A process in which a rater or raters evaluate the performance of another employee.</span></span>. A performance appraisal is a process in which a rater or raters evaluate the performance of an employee. More specifically, during a performance appraisal period, rater(s) observe, interact with, and evaluate a person’s performance. Then, when it is time for a performance appraisal, these observations are documented on a form. The rater usually conducts a meeting with the employee to communicate performance feedback. During the meeting, the employee is evaluated with respect to success in achieving last year’s goals, and new goals are set for the next performance appraisal period.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s03_s01_p02">Even though performance appraisals can be quite effective in motivating employees and resolving performance problems, in reality, only a small number of organizations use the performance appraisal process to its full potential. In many companies, a performance appraisal takes the form of a bureaucratic activity that is mutually despised by employees and managers. The problems a poor appraisal process can create may be so severe that many experts, including the founder of the total quality movement, Edward Deming, have recommended abolishing appraisals altogether.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_057">Carson, P. P., &amp; Carson, K. D. (1993). Deming versus traditional management theorists on goal setting: Can both be right? <em class="emphasis">Business Horizons</em>, <em class="emphasis">36</em>(5), 79–84.</span> On the other hand, creating and executing an effective appraisal system actually leads to higher levels of trust in management.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_058">Mayer, R. C., &amp; Davis, J. H. (1999). The effect of the performance appraisal system on trust for management: A field quasi-experiment. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">84</em>, 123–136.</span> Therefore, identifying ways of increasing appraisal effectiveness is important.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s03_s01_p03">Giving employees feedback is not synonymous with conducting a performance appraisal, because employees may (and should) receive frequent feedback. The most effective feedback immediately follows high or low performance. Therefore, waiting for a formal process to give feedback would be misguided. A formal appraisal is often conducted once a year, even though there are some organizations that conduct them more frequently. For example, there are advantages to conducting quarterly appraisals, such as allowing managers to revise goals more quickly in the face of changing environmental demands.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_059">Odiorne, G. S. (1990, July–August).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s03_s02_p01">Performance appraisals can be important tools to give employees feedback and aid in their development. Yet feedback is only one reason why companies perform appraisals. In many companies, appraisals are used to distribute rewards such as bonuses, annual pay raises, and promotions. They may also be used to document termination of employees. Research shows that performance appraisals tend to be viewed as more effective when companies tie them to reward decisions and to terminate lower performers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_060">Lawler, E. E., III. (2003). Reward practices and performance management system effectiveness. <em class="emphasis">Organizational Dynamics</em>, <em class="emphasis">32</em>(4), 396–404.</span> This is not surprising in light of motivation theories such as reinforcement theory, which indicates that behavior that is rewarded is repeated. Tying appraisal results to rewards may lead to the perception that performance is rewarded. However, if performance appraisal ratings are not accurate, it is possible for appraisals to be a major cause of reward unfairness.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Who Is the Rater?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s03_s03_p01">Traditionally, the rater has been the supervisor. Supervisors have more at stake when an employee is not performing well and they have access to greater resources that can be used to improve performance. However, relying solely on supervisors may lead to a biased appraisal system. Many aspects of a person’s performance may remain hidden from managers, particularly in team-based settings or organizations where supervisors do not work in the same physical setting as the employees. Therefore, organizations are introducing additional raters into the system, such as peers, customers, and subordinates. As organizations become more flat, introducing more perspectives may provide richer feedback to employees in question. Organizations using supervisors, peers, subordinates, and sometimes even customers are using <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">360-degree feedback</a><span class="glossdef">A system where feedback is gathered from supervisors, peers, subordinates, and sometimes even customers.</span></span>. In this system, feedback is gathered from all these sources, and shared with the employee for developmental purposes. It is important to note that 360-degree appraisals are not often used in determining pay or promotion decisions and instead are treated as feedback tools. Using 360-degree feedback in reward decisions may be problematic, because individuals may avoid giving objective feedback if it means causing a peer to lose a bonus. Since not all feedback will necessarily be positive, if competition or jealousy exists among peers, some feedback may be retaliatory and too negative. Keeping these problems in mind, organizations may benefit from using only supervisor ratings in reward decisions and using feedback from other sources for developmental purposes.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_061">Toegel, G., &amp; Conger, J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s03_s05_p01">As a student, would you rather be evaluated with respect to some objective criteria? For example, you could get an A if you correctly answer 90% of the questions in the exam, but would get a B if you answered only 80%. We are calling this type of appraisal an absolute rating because the grade you get depends only on your performance with respect to the objective criteria. The alternative to this approach is relative ranking. In this system, you would get an A if you are one of the top 10% of the students in class, but you would get a B if you are between 10% and 20%. In a relative ranking system, your rating depends on how your objective performance (test grade) compares with the rest of the students’ grades in your class.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s03_s05_p02">If you say you would prefer an absolute rating, you are not alone. Research shows that ranking systems are often viewed more negatively by employees. However, many major corporations such as General Electric Company (GE), Intel, and Yahoo! Inc. are using relative rankings and truly believe in its advantages. For example, Jack Welch, the former CEO of General Electric, instituted a forced ranking system at GE in which 20% of employees would be in the top category, 70% would be in the middle, and 10% would be at the bottom rank. Employees who are repeatedly ranked at the lowest rank would be terminated. Relative rankings may create a culture of performance by making it clear that low performance is not tolerated; however, there are several downsides to rankings. First, these systems carry the danger of a potential lawsuit. Organizations such as Ford Motor Company and Microsoft faced lawsuits involving relative rankings, because employees who were older, female, or minority members were systematically being ranked in the lowest category with little justification. Second, relative rankings are also not consistent with creating a team spirit and may create a competitive, cutthroat environment. Enron Corporation was an organization that used relative rankings to its detriment. Third, relative systems have limited value in giving employees concrete feedback about what to do next year to get a better ranking. Despite their limitations, using them for a few years may help the organization become more performance-oriented and eliminate stagnation by weeding out some employees with persistent performance problems. As long as these systems fit with the company culture, are not used in a rigid manner, and are used for a short period of time, they may be beneficial to the organization.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_063">Boyle, M.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s03_s06_p01">A performance appraisal meeting is the most important component of a performance appraisal. After the rater uses the company’s appraisal form to evaluate the performance of the ratee, both sides meet to discuss positive and negative instances of performance. Thus, the meeting serves as the key medium through which the rater gives feedback to the ratee. The goal of providing performance feedback is to help the ratee solve performance problems and to motivate the employee to change behavior. Conducting this meeting is often stressful for both parties, and training managers in providing performance feedback may be useful to deal with the stress of the managers as well as creating a more positive experience for both parties.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_064">Davis, B.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s03_s06_p02">In the most effective meetings, feedback is presented in a constructive manner. Instead of criticizing the person, the focus should be on discussing the performance problems and aiding the employee in resolving these problems. By moving the focus of the conversation from the person to the behaviors, employee defensiveness may be reduced. When the supervisor is constructive, employees develop a more positive view of the appraisal system. Another approach to increasing the effectiveness of appraisal meetings is to increase employee participation. When employees have the opportunity to present their side of the story, they react more positively to the appraisal process and feel that the system is fair. Finally, supervisors should be knowledgeable about the employee’s performance. When it becomes clear that the person doing the evaluation has little understanding of the job being performed by the employee, reactions tend to be more negative.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_065">Cawley, B.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s03_s07_p01">Performance appraisal is by nature a subjective event. Unless the performance appraisal is purely relying on objective criteria such as sales, it requires one or more human beings to observe and evaluate another and arrive at a consensus. Raters, intentionally or unintentionally, make mistakes or exhibit biases. These biases trickle down into the appraisal system and can affect other decisions that are based on appraisals, such as pay and promotion. Therefore, being aware of these tendencies is the first step to managing their influence over the appraisal system.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Leniency</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s03_s07_s02_p01">One of the common problems in appraisals is that managers give employees ratings higher than warranted. There may be many reasons for this, such as the desire to avoid confrontation with the employee, having a very agreeable personality, the desire to avoid hurting the chances of the employee to get a bonus, the desire to motivate employees by giving them high ratings, or liking the employee as a person. Regardless of the reason, leniency is a problem because it makes ratings relatively useless for determining raises, bonuses, or promotions. At the same time, leniency makes it harder for employees to change their behaviors. One way of dealing with this problem could be using relative rankings or at least giving managers a suggested distribution. If managers are asked to grade on a curve, they may end up being less lenient. Moreover, making managers accountable for the ratings they give may be a good idea. For example, if managers are evaluated based on how well they recognize different levels of performance, they may be less tempted to be lenient in appraisals.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_069">Bernardin, H.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Stereotypes</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s03_s07_s03_p01">One of the factors that create bias in appraisals is the stereotypes that raters may have regarding the gender, race, age or another characteristic of the person being rated. Beliefs about different groups may be generalized to the person in question even though they may have little basis in reality. For example, research shows that women in stereotypically male jobs were rated lower than women in stereotypically female jobs. Similarly, attractive women were rated higher if they held nonmanagement jobs, but they were rated lower if they held management jobs. When factors that have no bearing on one’s job performance are used to evaluate the person, employees, overall, will be demoralized, the appraisals will lose their effectiveness, and the company may face costly lawsuits.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_070">Heilman, M.

                <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s03_s07_s03_p02">Performance appraisals involve observing and measuring an employee’s performance during an appraisal period, recording these observations, communicating results to the employee, and recognizing high performance while devising ways of improving deficiencies. Most appraisals are conducted by the supervisor, but there are many advantages to using 360-degree appraisals. Appraisals that are more effective give employees adequate notice, fair hearing, and judgment based on evidence. Some companies use relative rankings in which employees are compared to each other, but this system is not suitable to all companies. A performance appraisal meeting should be planned and executed carefully, with the supervisor demonstrating empathy and supportiveness. There are intentional and unintentional biases inherent in appraisals and being aware of them, increasing rater accountability, and training managers may be useful in dealing with some of them.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s04_s01_p01">Perhaps the most tangible way in which companies put motivation theories into action is by instituting incentive systems. Incentives are reward systems that tie pay to performance. There are many incentives used by companies, some tying pay to individual performance and some to companywide performance. Pay-for-performance plans are very common among organizations. For example, according to one estimate, 80% of all American companies have merit pay, and the majority of <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 1000 companies use incentives.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_071">Luthans, F., &amp; Stajkovic, A.

Reinforce for performance: The need to go beyond pay and even rewards. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Executive</em>, <em class="emphasis">13</em>, 49–57.</span> Using incentives to increase performance is a very old idea. For example, Napoleon promised 12,000 francs to whoever found a way to preserve food for the army.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s04_s01_p02">At the same time, many downsides of incentives exist. For example, it has been argued that incentives may create a risk-averse environment that diminishes creativity. This may happen if employees are rewarded for doing things in a certain way, and taking risks may negatively affect their paycheck. Moreover, research shows that incentives tend to focus employee energy to goal-directed efforts, and behaviors such as helping team members or being a good citizen of the company may be neglected.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_075">Breen, B.

For example, a manufacturer may pay employees based on the number of purses sewn or number of doors installed in a day. In the agricultural sector, fruit pickers are often paid based on the amount of fruit they pick. These systems are suitable when employee output is easily observable or quantifiable and when output is directly correlated with employee effort. Piece rate systems are also used in white-collar jobs such as check-proofing in banks. These plans may encourage employees to work very fast, but may also increase the number of errors made. Therefore, rewarding employee performance minus errors might be more effective. Today, increases in employee monitoring technology are making it possible to correctly measure and observe individual output. For example, technology can track the number of tickets an employee sells or the number of customer complaints resolved, allowing a basis for employee pay incentives.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_076">Conlin, M.

Often the company’s performance appraisal system is used to determine performance levels and the employees are awarded a raise, such as a 2% increase in pay. One potential problem with merit pay is that employees come to expect pay increases. In companies that give annual merit raises without a different raise for increases in cost of living, merit pay ends up serving as a cost-of-living adjustment and creates a sense of entitlement on the part of employees, with even low performers expecting them. Thus, making merit pay more effective depends on making it truly dependent on performance and designing a relatively objective appraisal system.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s04_s01_s05_p01">Some companies manage to create effective incentive systems on a small budget while downplaying the importance of large bonuses. It is possible to motivate employees through awards, plaques, or other symbolic methods of recognition to the degree these methods convey sincere appreciation for employee contributions. For example, Yum! Brands Inc., the parent company of brands such as KFC and Pizza Hut, recognizes employees who go above and beyond job expectations through creative awards such as the seat belt award (a seat belt on a plaque), symbolizing the roller-coaster-like, fast-moving nature of the industry. Other awards include things such as a plush toy shaped like a jalapeño pepper. Hewlett-Packard Development Company LP has the golden banana award, which came about when a manager wanted to reward an employee who solved an important problem on the spot and handed him a banana lying around the office. Later, the golden banana award became an award bestowed on the most innovative employees.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_079">Nelson, B. (2009). Secrets of successful employee recognition.

These methods are more effective if employees have a choice among alternatives (such as between restaurants, or between a restaurant or a retailer). The advantage of gift cards over pay is that instead of paying for life’s necessities such as mortgage or college, employees can enjoy the gift of going out to dinner, going on a vacation to a fun place, or acquiring a cool gadget they may not have purchased with their own money. Thus, these awards may help create a sense of commitment to the company by creating positive experiences that are attributed to the company.</p>

For example, a company would commit to sell company stock to employees or managers 2 years in the future at $30 per share. If the company’s actual stock price in 2 years is $60, employees would make a profit by exercising their options at $30 and then selling them in the stock market. The purpose of stock options is to align company and employee interests by making employees owners. However, options are not very useful for this purpose, because employees tend to sell the stock instead of holding onto it. In the past, options were given to a wide variety of employees, including CEOs, high performers, and in some companies all employees. For example, Starbucks Corporation was among companies that offered stock to a large number of associates. Options remain popular in start-up companies that find it difficult to offer competitive salaries to employees. In fact, many employees in high-tech companies such as Microsoft and Cisco Systems Inc. became millionaires by cashing in stock options after these companies went public. In recent years, stock option use has declined. One reason for this is the changes in options accounting. Before 2005, companies did not have to report options as an expense. After the changes in accounting rules, it became more expensive for companies to offer options. Moreover, options are less attractive or motivational for employees when the stock market is going down, because the cost of exercising their options may be higher than the market value of the shares. Because of these and other problems, some companies started granting employees actual stock or using other incentives. For example, PepsiCo Inc. replaced parts of the stock options program with a cash incentive program and gave managers the choice of getting stock options coupled with restricted stocks.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_081">Brandes, P., Dharwadkar, R., Lemesis, G.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Designing a Motivating Work Environment and Ethics</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s05_s01_p01">The design components of an organization’s internal environment, such as the presence of goal setting, performance appraisals, and the use of incentive-based reward systems, have a direct connection with the level of ethical or unethical behaviors demonstrated within a company. Although a large number of companies successfully use goal setting and rewarding employees based on goal accomplishment, there is an unintended consequence to using goals: Goal setting may lead to unethical behaviors on the part of employees. When goal accomplishment is rewarded, and when rewards are desirable, employees will have two basic options: Work hard to reach the goals, or cheat.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s05_s01_p02">The connection between goal setting and unethical behaviors has been well documented. For example, teachers rewarded for their students’ success were more likely to cheat by giving the answers to students. Sanitation workers on an incentive scheme were more likely to take their trucks to the landfill with loads exceeding legal limits.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_082">Pfeffer, J. (2004). Sins of commission. <em class="emphasis">Business 2.0</em>, <em class="emphasis">5</em>(4), 56.</span> Salespeople working on commissions may push customers to make a purchase beyond their budget. At higher levels within companies, a CEO’s method of payment has been related to the ethical behaviors of companies. For example, when a large percentage of a CEO pay package consists of stock options, companies are more likely to misrepresent the financial situation of the company, particularly when the CEO is also the head of the board of directors.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_083">Harris, J., &amp; Bromiley, P. (2007). Incentives to cheat: The influence of executive compensation and firm performance on financial misrepresentation. <em class="emphasis">Organization Science</em>, <em class="emphasis">18</em>, 350–367; Priem, R. L., Coombs, J. E., &amp; Gilley, K. M. (2006). Do CEO stock options prevent or promote fraudulent financial reporting? <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal</em>, <em class="emphasis">49</em>, 483–500.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s05_s01_p03">This does not mean that goal setting always causes unethical behavior. People who behave unethically tend to constitute a small percentage of the workforce. However, for this small percentage, goal setting and incentives act as motivation to behave unethically. The tendency to behave unethically under these systems also increases when goals are not met, but instead, employees come close to reaching them, particularly when they are competing against each other to receive the rewards.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_084">Bellizzi, J. A. (1995). Committing and supervising unethical sales force behavior: The effects of victim gender, victim status, and sales force motivational techniques. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personal Selling &amp; Sales Management</em>, <em class="emphasis">15</em>, 1–15; Schweitzer, M. E., Ordonez, L., &amp; Douma, B. (2004). Goal setting as a motivator of unethical behavior. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal</em>, <em class="emphasis">47</em>, 422–432.</span> There are several ways companies can reduce the temptation to behave unethically. Specifically rewarding ethical behavior within the company is related to lower levels of unethical behaviors.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_085">Trevino, L. K., &amp; Youngblood, S. A. (1990). Bad apples in bad barrels: A causal analysis of ethical decision-making behavior. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">75</em>, 378–385.</span> Also, instead of only rewarding people who reach a high goal and not giving anything to those who come close, companies may consider creating multiple levels of goals and distribute rewards corresponding to the goal that is achieved.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_086">Locke, E. A. (2004). Linking goals to monetary incentives. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Executive</em>, <em class="emphasis">18</em>, 130–133.</span> Enforcing an ethical code of conduct and withholding rewards from those who are not demonstrating ethical behaviors are other ways of preventing goal setting from leading to unethical behaviors.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Designing a Motivating Work Environment Around the Globe</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s05_s02_p01">The effectiveness of methods such as job design, goal setting, performance appraisals, and the use of incentives is likely to be culturally determined. For example, research conducted in Western countries suggests that empowering employees is an effective method of motivating them. However, not all employees around the world respond favorably to concepts such as autonomy or empowerment. For example, it has been noted that the use of self-managing teams, a method of increasing employee empowerment in the workplace, is difficult to execute in Mexican companies because of the traditionally paternalistic and hierarchical nature of many Mexican organizations. In such a context, employees may not be willing or ready to take responsibility for individual action, while managers may be unwilling to share real power with employees.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_087">Nicholls, C. E., Lane, H. W., &amp; Brechu, M. B. (1999). Taking self-managed teams to Mexico. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Executive</em>, <em class="emphasis">13</em>(3), 15–25.</span> Researchers also found in a four-country study that while employees in the United States, Mexico, and Poland responded positively to empowerment, Indian employees were actually less satisfied when they were empowered.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_088">Robert, C., Probst, T. M., Martocchio, J. J., Drasgow, F., &amp; Lawler, J. J. (2000). Empowerment and continuous improvement in the United States, Mexico, Poland, and India: Predicting fit on the basis of the dimensions of power distance and individualism. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">85</em>, 643–658.</span> In other words, we may expect both greater levels of difficulty and potentially different reactions to empowerment depending on the cultural context.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s05_s02_p02">Are all employees around the globe motivated by goal setting? Even though there is limited research in this area, existing findings point to some differences. For example, we know that American employees respond negatively to goals when these goals are perceived to be extremely difficult. However, Chinese employees actually were most motivated when the goals were very difficult. This may be because Chinese employees believe that their performance depends on their effort, and therefore, they are able to respond to goals that are very difficult with very high effort. On the other hand, there is some evidence that while specific goals motivate Western salespeople, in China goals low in specificity were more motivational.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn06_089">Fang, E., Palmatier, R. W., &amp; Evans, K. R. (2004). Goal-setting paradoxes? Trade-offs between working hard and working smart: The United States versus China. <em class="emphasis">Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science</em>, <em class="emphasis">32</em>, 188–202.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s05_s02_p03">How about performance appraisals? You may predict that concepts such as 360-degree appraisal are not suitable to all cultures. The 360-degree appraisals require a climate of openness and social equality in the workplace. Therefore, countries high in power distance and authoritarianism may respond negatively to appraisal systems where lower level employees give performance feedback to their managers. Likewise, in cultures high in collectivism, using peer appraisals may not be as effective, because employees might be hesitant to give accurate performance feedback to their colleagues with the fear that negative feedback may damage interpersonal relationships.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s05_s02_p04">Goal setting and reward systems influence the level of ethics in the work environment. When employees come close to reaching their goals but fall short, they are more likely to behave unethically. The type of incentive system used in a company may generate unethical behaviors. Moreover, job design, goal setting, performance appraisals, and incentives should be designed while considering the national culture context, because they may not be universally valid.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch06b_s01_p01">As of 2010, Xerox Corporation (NYSE: XRX) is a $22 billion, multinational company founded in 1906 and operating in 160 countries. Xerox is headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, and employs 130,000 people. How does a company of such size and magnitude effectively manage and motivate employees from diverse backgrounds and experiences? Such companies depend on the productivity and performance of their employees. The journey over the last 100 years has withstood many successes and failures. In 2000, Xerox was facing bankruptcy after years of mismanagement, piles of debt, and mounting questions about its accounting practices.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch06b_s01_p02">Anne Mulcahy turned Xerox around. Mulcahy joined Xerox as an employee in 1976 and moved up the corporate ladder, holding several management positions until she became CEO in 2001. In 2005, Mulcahy was named by <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> magazine as the second most powerful woman in business. Based on a lifetime of experience with Xerox, she knew that the company had powerful employees who were not motivated when she took over. Mulcahy believed that among other key businesses changes, motivating employees at Xerox was a key way to pull the company back from the brink of failure. One of her guiding principles was a belief that in order to achieve customer satisfaction, employees must be interested and motivated in their work. Mulcahy not only successfully saw the company through this difficult time but also was able to create a stronger and more focused company.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch06b_s01_p03">In 2009, Mulcahy became the chairman of Xerox’s board of directors and passed the torch to Ursula Burns, who became the new CEO of Xerox. Burns became not only the first African American woman CEO to head a Standard &amp; Poor’s (S&amp;P) company but also the first woman to succeed another woman as the head of an S&amp;P 100 company. Burns is also a lifetime Xerox employee who has been with the company for over 30 years. She began as a graduate intern and was hired full time after graduation. Because of her tenure with Xerox, she has close relationships with many of the employees, which provides a level of comfort and teamwork. She describes Xerox as a nice family. She maintains that Mulcahy created a strong and successful business but encouraged individuals to speak their mind, to not worry about hurting one another’s feelings, and to be more critical.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch06b_s01_p04">Burns explains that she learned early on in her career, from her mentors at Xerox, the importance of managing individuals in different ways and not intentionally intimidating people but rather relating to them and their individual perspectives. As CEO, she wants to encourage people to get things done, take risks, and not be afraid of those risks. She motivates her teams by letting them know what her intentions and priorities are. The correlation between a manager’s leadership style and the productivity and motivation of employees is apparent at Xerox, where employees feel a sense of importance and a part of the process necessary to maintain a successful and profitable business. In 2010, Anne Mulcahy retired from her position on the board of directors to pursue new projects.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch06_s06_p01">In this chapter, we reviewed specific methods with which companies attempt to motivate their workforce. Designing jobs to increase their motivating potential, empowering employees, setting goals, evaluating performance using performance appraisals, and tying employee pay to individual, group, or organizational performance using incentive systems are methods through which motivation theories are put into action. Even though these methods seem to have advantages, every method could have unintended consequences, and therefore, application of each method should be planned and executed with an eye to organizational fairness.</p>
