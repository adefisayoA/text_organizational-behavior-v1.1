        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch01_s02_s01_p01">In order to maximize your learning in this course and in any learning situation, it’s important to understand what type of learner you are. Some people learn better by seeing information. For example, if you notice that you retain more information by reading and seeing diagrams and flow charts, you may be a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">visual learner</a><span class="glossdef">One who processes information most effectively by looking at words and diagrams.</span></span>. If you primarily learn by listening to others such as in lectures, conversations, and videos, you may be an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">auditory learner</a><span class="glossdef">One who processes information most effectively by listening or talking.</span></span>. Finally, if you have a preference for actually doing things and learning from trial and error, you may be a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">kinesthetic learner</a><span class="glossdef">One who processes information most effectively by actively engaging with the material.</span></span>. If you are unaware of what your primary learning style is, take a moment to diagnose it at the Web site listed below.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch01_s02_s01_p05">For various reasons, using flash cards seems to help with all three learning styles. For example, for an auditory learner, saying the answers aloud when using flash cards helps to solidify concepts. For a visual learner, seeing the answers written down on the flash card can be helpful. And for the kinesthetic learner, the act of creating and organizing flash cards helps the concepts stick.</p>
