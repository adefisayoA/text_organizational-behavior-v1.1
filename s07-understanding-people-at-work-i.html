    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_p08">Individuals bring a number of differences to work, such as unique personalities, values, emotions, and moods. When new employees enter organizations, their stable or transient characteristics affect how they behave and perform. Moreover, companies hire people with the expectation that those individuals have certain skills, abilities, personalities, and values. Therefore, it is important to understand individual characteristics that matter for employee behaviors at work.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">3.1</span> Advice for Hiring Successful Employees: The Case of Guy Kawasaki</h2>
    <div class="callout block" id="fwk-122425-ch03a_s01_n01">
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch03a_s01_p01">When people think about entrepreneurship, they often think of Guy Kawasaki (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.guykawasaki.com">http://www.guykawasaki.com</a>), who is a Silicon Valley venture capitalist and the author of nine books as of 2010, including <em class="emphasis">The Art of the Start</em> and <em class="emphasis">The Macintosh Way</em>. Beyond being a best-selling author, he has been successful in a variety of areas, including earning degrees from Stanford University and UCLA; being an integral part of Apple’s first computer; writing columns for <em class="emphasis">Forbes</em> and <em class="emphasis">Entrepreneur Magazine</em>; and taking on entrepreneurial ventures such as cofounding Alltop, an aggregate news site, and becoming managing director of Garage Technology Ventures. Kawasaki is a believer in the power of individual differences. He believes that successful companies include people from many walks of life, with different backgrounds and with different strengths and different weaknesses. Establishing an effective team requires a certain amount of self-monitoring on the part of the manager. Kawasaki maintains that most individuals have personalities that can easily get in the way of this objective. He explains, “The most important thing is to hire people who complement you and are better than you in specific areas. Good people hire people that are better than themselves.” He also believes that mediocre employees hire less-talented employees in order to feel better about themselves. Finally, he believes that the role of a leader is to produce more leaders, not to produce followers, and to be able to achieve this, a leader should compensate for their weaknesses by hiring individuals who compensate for their shortcomings.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch03a_s01_p02">In today’s competitive business environment, individuals want to think of themselves as indispensable to the success of an organization. Because an individual’s perception that he or she is the most important person on a team can get in the way, Kawasaki maintains that many people would rather see a company fail than thrive without them. He advises that we must begin to move past this and to see the value that different perceptions and values can bring to a company, and the goal of any individual should be to make the organization that one works for stronger and more dynamic. Under this type of thinking, leaving a company in better shape than one found it becomes a source of pride. Kawasaki has had many different roles in his professional career and as a result realized that while different perceptions and attitudes might make the implementation of new protocol difficult, this same diversity is what makes an organization more valuable. Some managers fear diversity and the possible complexities that it brings, and they make the mistake of hiring similar individuals without any sort of differences. When it comes to hiring, Kawasaki believes that the initial round of interviews for new hires should be held over the phone. Because first impressions are so important, this ensures that external influences, negative or positive, are not part of the decision-making process.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch03a_s01_p03">Many people come out of business school believing that if they have a solid financial understanding, then they will be a successful and appropriate leader and manager. Kawasaki has learned that mathematics and finance are the “easy” part of any job. He observes that the true challenge comes in trying to effectively manage people. With the benefit of hindsight, Kawasaki regrets the choices he made in college, saying, “I should have taken organizational behavior and social psychology” to be better prepared for the individual nuances of people. He also believes that working hard is a key to success and that individuals who learn how to learn are the most effective over time.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch03a_s01_p04">If nothing else, Guy Kawasaki provides simple words of wisdom to remember when starting off on a new career path: do not become blindsided by your mistakes, but rather take them as a lesson of what not to do. And most important, pursue joy and challenge your personal assumptions.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s01_p01">Individual differences matter in the workplace. Human beings bring in their personality, physical and mental abilities, and other stable traits to work. Imagine that you are interviewing an employee who is proactive, creative, and willing to take risks. Would this person be a good job candidate? What behaviors would you expect this person to demonstrate?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s01_p02">The question posed above is misleading. While human beings bring their traits to work, every organization is different, and every job within the organization is also different. According to the interactionist perspective, behavior is a function of the person and the situation interacting with each other. Think about it. Would a shy person speak up in class? While a shy person may not feel like speaking, if the individual is very interested in the subject, knows the answers to the questions, and feels comfortable within the classroom environment, and if the instructor encourages participation and participation is 30% of the course grade, regardless of the level of shyness, the person may feel inclined to participate. Similarly, the behavior you may expect from someone who is proactive, creative, and willing to take risks will depend on the situation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s01_p03">When hiring employees, companies are interested in assessing at least two types of fit. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Person–organization fit</a><span class="glossdef">The degree to which a person’s values, personality, goals, and other characteristics match those of the organization.</span></span> refers to the degree to which a person’s values, personality, goals, and other characteristics match those of the organization. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Person–job fit</a><span class="glossdef">The degree to which a person’s skill, knowledge, abilities, and other characteristics match the job demands.</span></span> is the degree to which a person’s skill, knowledge, abilities, and other characteristics match the job demands. Thus, someone who is proactive and creative may be a great fit for a company in the high-tech sector that would benefit from risk-taking individuals, but may be a poor fit for a company that rewards routine and predictable behavior, such as accountants. Similarly, this person may be a great fit for a job such as a scientist, but a poor fit for a routine office job. The opening case illustrates one method of assessing person–organization and person–job fit in job applicants.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s01_p04">The first thing many recruiters look at is the person–job fit. This is not surprising, because person–job fit is related to a number of positive work attitudes such as satisfaction with the work environment, identification with the organization, job satisfaction, and work behaviors such as job performance. Companies are often also interested in hiring candidates who will fit into the company culture (those with high person–organization fit). When people fit into their organization, they tend to be more satisfied with their jobs, more committed to their companies, and more influential in their company, and they actually remain longer in their company.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_001">Anderson, C., Spataro, S.

It all depends on the fit. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">87</em>, 646–654.</span> One area of controversy is whether these people perform better. Some studies have found a positive relationship between person–organization fit and job performance, but this finding was not present in all studies, so it seems that fitting with a company’s culture will only sometimes predict job performance.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_002">Arthur, W., Bell, S.

The use of person–organization fit in employment decision making: An assessment of its criterion-related validity. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">91</em>, 786–801.</span> It also seems that fitting in with the company culture is more important to some people than to others. For example, people who have worked in multiple companies tend to understand the impact of a company’s culture better, and therefore they pay more attention to whether they will fit in with the company when making their decisions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_003">Kristof-Brown, A.

        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s01_p05">While personality traits and other individual differences are important, we need to keep in mind that behavior is jointly determined by the person and the situation.

(1973). <em class="emphasis">The nature of human values</em>. New York: Free Press.</span> The values that are important to people tend to affect the types of decisions they make, how they perceive their environment, and their actual behaviors. Moreover, people are more likely to accept job offers when the company possesses the values people care about.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_006">Judge, T. A., &amp; Bretz, R. D. (1992).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s01_p02">What are the values people care about? There are many typologies of values. One of the most established surveys to assess individual values is the Rokeach Value Survey.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_008">Rokeach, M. (1973). <em class="emphasis">The nature of human values.</em> New York: The Free Press.</span> This survey lists 18 terminal and 18 instrumental values in alphabetical order. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Terminal values</a><span class="glossdef">End states people desire in life, such as leading a prosperous life and a world at peace.</span></span> refer to end states people desire in life, such as leading a prosperous life and a world at peace. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Instrumental values</a><span class="glossdef">Views on acceptable modes of conduct, such as being honest and ethical, and being ambitious.</span></span> deal with views on acceptable modes of conduct, such as being honest and ethical, and being ambitious.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s01_p03">According to Rokeach, values are arranged in hierarchical fashion. In other words, an accurate way of assessing someone’s values is to ask them to rank the 36 values in order of importance. By comparing these values, people develop a sense of which value can be sacrificed to achieve the other, and the individual priority of each value emerges.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s01_p04">Where do values come from? Research indicates that they are shaped early in life and show stability over the course of a lifetime. Early family experiences are important influences over the dominant values. People who were raised in families with low socioeconomic status and those who experienced restrictive parenting often display conformity values when they are adults, while those who were raised by parents who were cold toward their children would likely value and desire security.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_009">Kasser, T., Koestner, R., &amp; Lekes, N. (2002). Early family experiences and adult values: A 26-year prospective longitudinal study. <em class="emphasis">Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin</em>, <em class="emphasis">28</em>, 826–835.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s01_p05">Values of a generation also change and evolve in response to the historical context that the generation grows up in. Research comparing the values of different generations resulted in interesting findings. For example, Generation Xers (those born between the mid-1960s and 1980s) are more individualistic and are interested in working toward organizational goals so long as they coincide with their personal goals. This group, compared to the baby boomers (born between the 1940s and 1960s), is also less likely to see work as central to their life and more likely to desire a quick promotion.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_010">Smola, K. W., &amp; Sutton, C. D. (2002). Generational differences: Revisiting generational work values for the new millennium. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Organizational Behavior</em>, <em class="emphasis">23</em>, 363–382.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s01_p06">The values a person holds will affect his or her employment. For example, someone who has an orientation toward strong stimulation may pursue extreme sports and select an occupation that involves fast action and high risk, such as fire fighter, police officer, or emergency medical doctor. Someone who has a drive for achievement may more readily act as an entrepreneur. Moreover, whether individuals will be satisfied at a given job may depend on whether the job provides a way to satisfy their dominant values. Therefore, understanding employees at work requires understanding the value orientations of employees.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Personality</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Personality</a><span class="glossdef">The relatively stable feelings, thoughts, and behavioral patterns a person has.</span></span> encompasses the relatively stable feelings, thoughts, and behavioral patterns a person has. Our personality differentiates us from other people, and understanding someone’s personality gives us clues about how that person is likely to act and feel in a variety of situations. In order to effectively manage organizational behavior, an understanding of different employees’ personalities is helpful. Having this knowledge is also useful for placing people in jobs and organizations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s02_p02">If personality is stable, does this mean that it does not change? You probably remember how you have changed and evolved as a result of your own life experiences, attention you received in early childhood, the style of parenting you were exposed to, successes and failures you had in high school, and other life events. In fact, our personality changes over long periods of time. For example, we tend to become more socially dominant, more conscientious (organized and dependable), and more emotionally stable between the ages of 20 and 40, whereas openness to new experiences may begin to decline during this same time.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_011">Roberts, B.

While we will discuss the effects of personality for employee behavior, you must remember that the relationships we describe are modest correlations. For example, having a sociable and outgoing personality may encourage people to seek friends and prefer social situations. This does not mean that their personality will immediately affect their work behavior. At work, we have a job to do and a role to perform. Therefore, our behavior may be more strongly affected by what is expected of us, as opposed to how we want to behave. When people have a lot of freedom at work, their personality will become a stronger influence over their behavior.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_013">Barrick, M. R., &amp; Mount, M. K.

In every language, there are many words describing a person’s personality. In fact, in the English language, more than 15,000 words describing personality have been identified. When researchers analyzed the terms describing personality characteristics, they realized that there were many words that were pointing to each dimension of personality. When these words were grouped, five dimensions seemed to emerge that explain a lot of the variation in our personalities.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_014">Goldberg, L. R. (1990).

There are other, specific traits that represent dimensions not captured by the Big Five. Still, understanding the main five traits gives us a good start for describing personality.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p01">Aside from the Big Five personality traits, perhaps the most well-known and most often used personality assessment is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Unlike the Big Five, which assesses traits, MBTI measures types. Assessments of the Big Five do not classify people as neurotic or extravert: It is all a matter of degrees. MBTI on the other hand, classifies people as one of 16 types.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_039">Carlyn, M. (1977). An assessment of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality Assessment</em>, <em class="emphasis">41</em>, 461–473; Myers, I. B. (1962). <em class="emphasis">The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</em>. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.</span> In MBTI, people are grouped using four dimensions. Based on how a person is classified on these four dimensions, it is possible to talk about 16 unique personality types, such as ESTJ and ISTP.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p02">MBTI was developed in 1943 by a mother–daughter team, Isabel Myers and Katherine Cook Briggs. Its objective at the time was to aid World War II veterans in identifying the occupation that would suit their personalities. Since that time, MBTI has become immensely popular, and according to one estimate, around 2.5 million people take the test annually. The survey is criticized because it relies on types as opposed to traits, but organizations who use the survey find it very useful for training and team-building purposes. More than 80 of the <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 100 companies used Myers-Briggs tests in some form. One distinguishing characteristic of this test is that it is explicitly designed for learning, not for employee selection purposes. In fact, the Myers &amp; Briggs Foundation has strict guidelines against the use of the test for employee selection. Instead, the test is used to provide mutual understanding within the team and to gain a better understanding of the working styles of team members.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_040">Leonard, D., &amp; Straus, S.

                <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s02_s03_p02">Employees who have high levels of neuroticism or high levels of negative affectivity may act overly negative at work, criticize others, complain about trivial things, or create an overall negative work environment. Here are some tips for how to work with them effectively.</p>

                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Understand that you are unlikely to change someone else’s personality</em>. Personality is relatively stable and criticizing someone’s personality will not bring about change. If the behavior is truly disruptive, focus on behavior, not personality.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Keep an open mind</em>. Just because a person is constantly negative does not mean that they are not sometimes right. Listen to the feedback they are giving you.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Set a time limit</em>. If you are dealing with someone who constantly complains about things, you may want to limit these conversations to prevent them from consuming your time at work.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">You may also empower them to act on the negatives they mention</em>. The next time an overly negative individual complains about something, ask that person to think of ways to change the situation and get back to you.</li>
                    <li>
<em class="emphasis">Ask for specifics</em>. If someone has a negative tone in general, you may want to ask for specific examples for what the problem is.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s03_p01">Personality is a potentially important predictor of work behavior. Matching people to jobs matters, because when people do not fit with their jobs or the company, they are more likely to leave, costing companies as much as a person’s annual salary to replace them. In job interviews, companies try to assess a candidate’s personality and the potential for a good match, but interviews are only as good as the people conducting them. In fact, interviewers are not particularly good at detecting the best trait that predicts performance: conscientiousness.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_068">Barrick, M. R., Patton, G.

Accuracy of interviewer judgments of job applicant personality traits. <em class="emphasis">Personnel Psychology</em>, <em class="emphasis">53</em>, 925–951.</span> One method some companies use to improve this match and detect the people who are potentially good job candidates is personality testing. Companies such as Kronos and Hogan Assessment Systems conduct preemployment personality tests. Companies using them believe that these tests improve the effectiveness of their selection and reduce turnover. For example, Overnight Transportation in Atlanta found that using such tests reduced their on-the-job delinquency by 50%–100%.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_069">Emmett, A. (2004).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s03_p02">Yet, are these methods good ways of selecting employees? Experts have not yet reached an agreement on this subject and the topic is highly controversial. Some experts believe, based on data, that personality tests predict performance and other important criteria such as job satisfaction. However, we must understand that how a personality test is used influences its validity. Imagine filling out a personality test in class. You may be more likely to fill it out as honestly as you can. Then, if your instructor correlates your personality scores with your class performance, we could say that the correlation is meaningful. In employee selection, one complicating factor is that people filling out the survey do not have a strong incentive to be honest. In fact, they have a greater incentive to guess what the job requires and answer the questions to match what they think the company is looking for. As a result, the rankings of the candidates who take the test may be affected by their ability to fake. Some experts believe that this is a serious problem.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_070">Morgeson, F. P., Campion, M. A., Dipboye, R. L., Hollenbeck, J. R., Murphy, K., &amp; Schmitt, N.

This issue raises potential questions regarding whether personality tests are the most effective way of measuring candidate personality.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s03_p03">Scores are not only distorted because of some candidates faking better than others. Do we even know our own personality? Are we the best person to ask this question? How supervisors, coworkers, and customers see our personality matters more than how we see ourselves. Therefore, using self-report measures of performance may not be the best way of measuring someone’s personality.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_072">Mount, M. K., Barrick, M.

We may also give “aspirational” answers.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s03_p04">There is another problem with using these tests: How good a predictor of performance is personality anyway? Based on research, not a particularly strong one. According to one estimate, personality only explains about 10%–15% of variation in job performance. Our performance at work depends on so many factors, and personality does not seem to be the key factor for performance. In fact, cognitive ability (your overall mental intelligence) is a much more powerful influence on job performance, and instead of personality tests, cognitive ability tests may do a better job of predicting who will be good performers. Personality is a better predictor of job satisfaction and other attitudes, but screening people out on the assumption that they may be unhappy at work is a challenging argument to make in the context of employee selection.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s03_p05">In any case, if you decide to use these tests for selection, you need to be aware of their limitations. Relying only on personality tests for selection of an employee is a bad idea, but if they are used together with other tests such as tests of cognitive abilities, better decisions may be made. The company should ensure that the test fits the job and actually predicts performance. This process is called validating the test. Before giving the test to applicants, the company could give it to existing employees to find out the traits that are most important for success in the particular company and job. Then, in the selection context, the company can pay particular attention to those traits. The company should also make sure that the test does not discriminate against people on the basis of sex, race, age, disabilities, and other legally protected characteristics. Rent-A-Center experienced legal difficulties when the test they used was found to be a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The test they used for selection, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, was developed to diagnose severe mental illnesses and included items such as “I see things or people around me others do not see.” In effect, the test served the purpose of a clinical evaluation and was discriminating against people with mental illnesses, which is a protected category under ADA.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_073">Heller, M.

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaway</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s02_s03_p06">Values and personality traits are two dimensions on which people differ. Values are stable life goals. When seeking jobs, employees are more likely to accept a job that provides opportunities for value attainment, and they are more likely to remain in situations that satisfy their values. Personality comprises the stable feelings, thoughts, and behavioral patterns people have. The Big Five personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) are important traits that seem to be stable and can be generalized to other cultures. Other important traits for work behavior include self-efficacy, self-esteem, social monitoring, proactive personality, positive and negative affectivity, and locus of control. It is important to remember that a person’s behavior depends on the match between the person and the situation. While personality is a strong influence on job attitudes, its relation to job performance is weaker. Some companies use personality testing to screen out candidates. This method has certain limitations, and companies using personality tests are advised to validate their tests and use them as a supplement to other techniques that have greater validity.</p>

What makes human perception so interesting is that we do not solely respond to the stimuli in our environment. We go beyond the information that is present in our environment, pay selective attention to some aspects of the environment, and ignore other elements that may be immediately apparent to other people. Our perception of the environment is not entirely rational. For example, have you ever noticed that while glancing at a newspaper or a news Web site, information that is interesting or important to you jumps out of the page and catches your eye? If you are a sports fan, while scrolling down the pages you may immediately see a news item describing the latest success of your team. If you are the parent of a picky eater, an advice column on toddler feeding may be the first thing you see when looking at the page.

Stereotypes are generalizations based on group characteristics. For example, believing that women are more cooperative than men, or men are more assertive than women, is a stereotype. Stereotypes may be positive, negative, or neutral. Human beings have a natural tendency to categorize the information around them to make sense of their environment. What makes stereotypes potentially discriminatory and a perceptual bias is the tendency to generalize from a group to a particular individual.

If you had met her on a different day, you could have thought that she is a really nice person who is unusually stressed these days. But chances are your impression that she is rude and unhelpful will not change even when you hear about her mother. Instead, this new piece of information will be added to the first one: She is rude, unhelpful, and her mother is sick. Being aware of this tendency and consciously opening your mind to new information may protect you against some of the downsides of this bias. Also, it would be to your advantage to pay careful attention to the first impressions you create, particularly during job interviews.</p>

            <h3 class="title">OB Toolbox: How Can I Make a Great First Impression in the Job Interview?</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_s03_p08">A job interview is your first step to getting the job of your dreams. It is also a social interaction in which your actions during the first 5 minutes will determine the impression you make. Here are some tips to help you create a positive first impression.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_s03_l01">
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Your first opportunity to make a great impression starts even before the interview, the moment you send your résumé</em>. Be sure that you send your résumé to the correct people, and spell the name of the contact person correctly! Make sure that your résumé looks professional and is free from typos and grammar problems. Have someone else read it before you hit the send button or mail it.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be prepared for the interview</em>. Many interviews have some standard questions such as “tell me about yourself” or “why do you want to work here?” Be ready to answer these questions. Prepare answers highlighting your skills and accomplishments, and practice your message. Better yet, practice an interview with a friend. Practicing your answers will prevent you from regretting your answers or finding a better answer after the interview is over!</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Research the company</em>. If you know a lot about the company and the job in question, you will come out as someone who is really interested in the job. If you ask basic questions such as “what does this company do?” you will not be taken as a serious candidate. Visit the company’s Web site as well as others, and learn as much about the company and the job as you can.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">When you are invited for an office interview, be sure to dress properly</em>. Like it or not, the manner you dress is a big part of the impression you make. Dress properly for the job and company in question. In many jobs, wearing professional clothes, such as a suit, is expected. In some information technology jobs, it may be more proper to wear clean and neat business casual clothes (such as khakis and a pressed shirt) as opposed to dressing formally. Do some investigation about what is suitable. Whatever the norm is, make sure that your clothes fit well and are clean and neat.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Be on time to the interview</em>. Being late will show that you either don’t care about the interview or you are not very reliable. While waiting for the interview, don’t forget that your interview has already started. As soon as you enter the company’s parking lot, every person you see on the way or talk to may be a potential influence over the decision maker. Act professionally and treat everyone nicely.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">During the interview, be polite</em>. Use correct grammar, show eagerness and enthusiasm, and watch your body language. From your handshake to your posture, your body is communicating whether you are the right person for the job!</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_s04_p01">Your colleague Peter failed to meet the deadline. What do you do? Do you help him finish up his work? Do you give him the benefit of the doubt and place the blame on the difficulty of the project? Or do you think that he is irresponsible? Our behavior is a function of our perceptions. More specifically, when we observe others behave in a certain way, we ask ourselves a fundamental question: Why? Why did he fail to meet the deadline? Why did Mary get the promotion? Why did Mark help you when you needed help? The answer we give is the key to understanding our subsequent behavior. If you believe that Mark helped you because he is a nice person, your action will be different from your response if you think that Mark helped you because your boss pressured him to.</p>

Erin does not usually complain in other classes (high distinctiveness). Erin usually does not complain in finance class (low consistency). In this situation, you are likely to make an external attribution, such as thinking that finance homework is difficult. On the other hand, let’s assume that Erin is the only person complaining (low consensus). Erin complains in a variety of situations (low distinctiveness), and every time she is in finance, she complains (high consistency). In this situation, you are likely to make an internal attribution such as thinking that Erin is a negative person.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_085">Kelley, H. H. (1967).

When faced with poor performance, such as missing a deadline, we are more likely to punish the person if an internal attribution is made (such as “the person being unreliable”). In the same situation, if we make an external attribution (such as “the timeline was unreasonable”), instead of punishing the person we might extend the deadline or assign more help to the person. If we feel that someone’s failure is due to external causes, we may feel empathy toward the person and even offer help.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_088">LePine, J. A., &amp; Van Dyne, L.

            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s03_s04_p10">Perception is how we make sense of our environment in response to environmental stimuli. While perceiving our surroundings, we go beyond the objective information available to us, and our perception is affected by our values, needs, and emotions. There are many biases that affect human perception of objects, self, and others. When perceiving the physical environment, we fill in gaps and extrapolate from the available information. We also contrast physical objects to their surroundings and may perceive something as bigger, smaller, slower, or faster than it really is. In self-perception, we may commit the self-enhancement or self-effacement bias, depending on our personality. We also overestimate how much we are like other people. When perceiving others, stereotypes infect our behavior. Stereotypes may lead to self-fulfilling prophecies. Stereotypes are perpetuated because of our tendency to pay selective attention to aspects of the environment and ignore information inconsistent with our beliefs. When perceiving others, the attributions we make will determine how we respond to the situation. Understanding the perception process gives us clues to understand human behavior.</p>

Situational factors, rewards, and punishments following unethical choices as well as a company’s culture are extremely important, but the role of personality and personal values should not be ignored. Research reveals that people who have an economic value orientation, that is, those who value acquiring money and wealth, tend to make more unethical choices. In terms of personality, employees with external locus of control were found to make more unethical choices.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_089">Hegarty, W. H., &amp; Sims, H. P. (1978).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s04_s01_p02">Our perceptual processes are clear influences on whether or not we behave ethically and how we respond to other people’s unethical behaviors. It seems that self-enhancement bias operates for our ethical decisions as well: We tend to overestimate how ethical we are in general. Our self-ratings of ethics tend to be higher than how other people rate us. This belief can create a glaring problem: If we think that we are more ethical than we are, we will have little motivation to improve. Therefore, understanding how other people perceive our actions is important to getting a better understanding of ourselves.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s04_s01_p03">How we respond to unethical behavior of others will, to a large extent, depend on the attributions we make.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s04_s02_p01">Values that people care about vary around the world. In fact, when we refer to a country’s culture, we are referring to values that distinguish one nation from others. In other words, there is systematic variance in individuals’ personality and work values around the world, and this variance explains people’s behavior, attitudes, preferences, and the transferability of management practices to other cultures.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s04_s02_p02">When we refer to a country’s values, this does not mean that everyone in a given country shares the same values. People differ within and across nations. There will always be people who care more about money and others who care more about relationships within each culture. Yet there are also national differences in the percentage of people holding each value. A researcher from Holland, Geert Hofstede, conducted a landmark study covering over 60 countries and found that countries differ in four dimensions: the extent to which they put individuals or groups first (individualism), whether the society subscribes to equality or hierarchy among people (power distance), the degree to which the society fears change (uncertainty avoidance), and the extent to which the culture emphasizes acquiring money and being successful (masculinity).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_091">Hofstede, G.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s04_s02_p03">Are personality traits universal? Researchers found that personality traits identified in Western cultures translate well to other cultures. For example, the five-factor model of personality is universal in that it explains how people differ from each other in over 79 countries. At the same time, there is variation among cultures in the dominant personality traits. In some countries, extraverts seem to be the majority, and in some countries the dominant trait is low emotional stability. For example, people from Europe and the United States are characterized by higher levels of extraversion compared to those from Asia and Africa. There are many factors explaining why some personality traits are dominant in some cultures. For example, the presence of democratic values is related to extraversion. Because democracy usually protects freedom of speech, people may feel more comfortable socializing with strangers as well as with friends, partly explaining the larger number of extraverts in democratic nations. Research also shows that in regions of the world that historically suffered from infectious diseases, extraversion and openness to experience was less dominant. Infectious diseases led people to limit social contact with strangers, explaining higher levels of introversion. Plus, to cope with infectious diseases, people developed strict habits for hygiene and the amount of spice to use in food, and deviating from these standards was bad for survival. This explains the lower levels of openness to experience in regions that experienced infectious diseases.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_092">McCrae, R. R., &amp; Costa, P. T. (1997).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s04_s02_p04">Is basic human perception universal? It seems that there is variation around the globe in how we perceive other people as well as ourselves. One difference is the importance of the context. Studies show that when perceiving people or objects, Westerners pay more attention to the individual, while Asians pay more attention to the context. For example, in one study, when judging the emotion felt by the person, the Americans mainly looked at the face of the person in question, while the Japanese also considered the emotions of the people surrounding the focal person. In other words, the Asian subjects of the experiment derived meaning from the context as well as by looking at the person.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_093">Masuda, T., Ellsworth, P.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s04_s02_p05">There seems to be some variation in the perceptual biases we commit as well. For example, human beings have a tendency to self-enhance. We see ourselves in a more positive light than others do. Yet, the traits in which we self-enhance are culturally dependent. In Western cultures, people may overestimate how independent and self-reliant they are. In Asian cultures, such traits are not necessarily desirable, so they may not embellish their degree of independence. Yet, they may overestimate how cooperative and loyal to the group they are because these traits are more desirable in collectivistic cultures.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn03_094">Sedikides, C., Gaertner, L., &amp; Toguchi, Y.

            <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s04_s02_p10">There is a connection between how ethically we behave and our individual values, personality, and perception. Possessing values emphasizing economic well-being predicts unethical behavior. Having an external locus of control is also related to unethical decision making. We are also likely to overestimate how ethical we are, which can be a barrier against behaving ethically. Culture seems to be an influence over our values, personality traits, perceptions, attitudes, and work behaviors. Therefore, understanding individual differences requires paying careful attention to the cultural context.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch03b_s01_p01">You are interviewing a candidate for a position as a cashier in a supermarket. You need someone polite, courteous, patient, and dependable. The candidate you are talking to seems nice. But how do you know who is the right person for the job? Will the job candidate like the job or get bored? Will they have a lot of accidents on the job or be fired for misconduct? Don’t you wish you knew before hiring? One company approaches this problem scientifically, saving companies time and money on hiring hourly wage employees.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch03b_s01_p02">Retail employers do a lot of hiring, given their growth and high turnover rate. According to one estimate, replacing an employee who leaves in retail costs companies around $4,000. High turnover also endangers customer service. Therefore, retail employers have an incentive to screen people carefully so that they hire people with the best chance of being successful and happy on the job. Unicru, an employee selection company, developed software that quickly became a market leader in screening hourly workers. The company was acquired by Massachusetts-based Kronos Inc. (NASDAQ: KRON) in 2006 and is currently owned by a private equity firm.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch03b_s01_p03">The idea behind the software is simple: If you have a lot of employees and keep track of your data over time, you have access to an enormous resource. By analyzing this data, you can specify the profile of the “ideal” employee. The software captures the profile of the potential high performers, and applicants are screened to assess their fit with this particular profile. More important, the profile is continually updated as new employees are hired. As the database gets larger, the software does a better job of identifying the right people for the job.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch03b_s01_p04">If you applied for a job in retail, you may have already been a part of this database: the users of this system include giants such as Universal Studios, Costco Wholesale Corporation, Burger King, and other retailers and chain restaurants. In companies such as Albertsons or Blockbuster, applicants use a kiosk in the store to answer a list of questions and to enter their background, salary history, and other information. In other companies, such as some in the trucking industry, candidates enter the data through the Web site of the company they are applying to. The software screens people on basic criteria such as availability in scheduling as well as personality traits.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch03b_s01_p05">Candidates are asked to agree or disagree with statements such as “I often make last-minute plans” or “I work best when I am on a team.” After the candidates complete the questions, hiring managers are sent a report complete with a color-coded suggested course of action. Red means the candidate does not fit the job, yellow means proceed with caution, and green means the candidate can be hired on the spot. Interestingly, the company contends that faking answers to the questions of the software is not easy because it is difficult for candidates to predict the desired profile. For example, according to their research, being a successful salesman has less to do with being an extraverted and sociable person and more to do with a passion for the company’s product.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-122425-ch03b_s01_p06">Matching candidates to jobs has long been viewed as a key way of ensuring high performance and low turnover in the workplace, and advances in computer technology are making it easier and more efficient to assess candidate–job fit. Companies using such technology are cutting down the time it takes to hire people, and it is estimated that using such technologies lowers their turnover by 10%–30%.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">3.7</span> Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch03_s05_p01">In conclusion, in this chapter we have reviewed major individual differences that affect employee attitudes and behaviors. Our values and personality explain our preferences and the situations we feel comfortable with. Personality may influence our behavior, but the importance of the context in which behavior occurs should not be neglected. Many organizations use personality tests in employee selection, but the use of such tests is controversial because of problems such as faking and low predictive value of personality for job performance. Perception is how we interpret our environment. It is a major influence over our behavior, but many systematic biases color our perception and lead to misunderstandings.</p>

You have just found out that you will be given a personality assessment as part of the application process.

You are relatively sociable and can cope with some stress but honestly you are not very high in either trait. The job pays well and it is a great stepping-stone to better jobs. How are you going to respond when completing the personality questions? Are you going to make an effort to represent yourself as how you truly are? If so, there is a chance that you may not get the job. How about answering the questions to fit the salesperson profile? Isn’t everyone doing this to some extent anyway?</p>

One of the problems you encounter is that the people you send to other cultures for long-term (2- to 5-year) assignments have a high failure rate.

You suspect that this is because you have been sending people overseas solely because of their technical skills, which does not seem to be effective in predicting whether these people will make a successful adjustment to the local culture.
